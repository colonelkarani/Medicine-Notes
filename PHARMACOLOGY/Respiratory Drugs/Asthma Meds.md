Asthma medications are designed to both **control chronic inflammation and prevent symptoms**, as well as to provide **quick relief during asthma attacks**. They fall into several major categories with distinct roles:

## 1. **Bronchodilators**

These medications open (dilate) the airways by relaxing smooth muscles, relieving symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.

- **Short-Acting Beta-2 Agonists (SABA):**
    
    - Examples: _Albuterol (Ventolin, ProAir), Levalbuterol_
        
    - Usage: Quick-relief “rescue” inhalers used during an asthma attack or sudden symptoms
        
    - Onset: Rapid (within minutes), lasting 3–6 hours
        
    - Also used before exercise to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm
        
- **Long-Acting Beta-2 Agonists (LABA):**
    
    - Examples: _Salmeterol, Formoterol, Vilanterol_
        
    - Usage: Maintenance therapy; provide symptom control for 12–24 hours
        
    - Used only in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), never alone due to safety concerns
        
- **Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonists (LAMA):**
    
    - Examples: _Tiotropium, Umeclidinium_
        
    - Usage: Primarily for COPD but also for severe asthma in combination with ICS
        
    - Mechanism: Anticholinergics that reduce bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion
        

## 2. **Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS)**

- Examples: _Budesonide (Pulmicort), Fluticasone (Flovent), Beclomethasone (Qvar), Mometasone (Asmanex)_
    
- Role: First-line **long-term controller** therapy for reducing airway inflammation
    
- Usage: Taken daily to **prevent symptoms and exacerbations**, not for immediate relief
    
- Important: Should be used consistently even if symptoms improve, as they control underlying inflammation
    

## 3. **Leukotriene Modifiers**

- Examples: _Montelukast (Singulair), Zafirlukast (Accolate), Zileuton (Zyflo)_
    
- Mechanism: Block leukotrienes, chemical mediators causing inflammation and bronchoconstriction
    
- Usage: Oral medications, often used as add-on therapy with ICS, particularly in allergy-associated asthma or mild asthma
    

## 4. **Anticholinergics (Short-Acting and Long-Acting)**

- Short-acting: _Ipratropium_ often used in emergency settings with SABA
    
- Long-acting: _Tiotropium_ as above, mainly adjunct therapy for persistent asthma
    

## 5. **Biologic Therapies (Immunomodulators)**

Used for **severe asthma** with specific characteristics (e.g., eosinophilic or allergic asthma). Usually subcutaneous injections.

- Anti-IgE: _Omalizumab (Xolair)_
    
- Anti-IL-5: _Mepolizumab (Nucala), Reslizumab (Cinqair)_
    

## 6. **Others**

- **Mast cell stabilizers:** _Cromolyn, Nedocromil_ (rarely used)
    
- **Theophylline:** Older oral bronchodilator with anti-inflammatory effects, limited due to side effects
    
- **Oral corticosteroids:** For severe exacerbations or poorly controlled asthma, not for regular use due to systemic side effects
    

## 7. **Classification by Purpose**

|Medication Type|Purpose|Examples|Usage|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Quick-relief (Rescue)**|Rapid symptom relief|Albuterol, Levalbuterol|During attacks or before exercise|
|**Long-term control**|Prevent symptoms, reduce inflammation|ICS (budesonide), LABA, LAMA|Daily maintenance|
|**Leukotriene modifiers**|Anti-inflammatory, add-on therapy|Montelukast|Mild to moderate asthma|
|**Biologics**|Targeted therapy for severe asthma|Omalizumab, Mepolizumab|Severe eosinophilic/allergic asthma|
|**Systemic corticosteroids**|Severe exacerbations|Prednisone|Short-term use during attacks|

## Important Points

- **Short-acting bronchodilators** provide immediate relief but do not control inflammation, so they are _not_ substitutes for controller medications.
    
- **Inhaled corticosteroids** are the cornerstone of long-term asthma management.
    
- LABAs must always be combined with ICS to ensure safety and efficacy.
    
- Medications are chosen based on asthma severity, frequency of symptoms, and patient factors; therapy should be individualized with regular monitoring.
    

## Summary

Asthma treatment combines **quick-relief bronchodilators** for symptom control and **controller medications** such as inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers to prevent inflammation and exacerbations. Severe asthma may require biologics or systemic steroids. Consistent use and follow-up with healthcare providers optimize asthma control and reduce attacks.

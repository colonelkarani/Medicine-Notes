## Lung Volumes

- **Tidal Volume (TV)**  
    The amount of air inhaled or exhaled during a normal, relaxed breath.  
    _Average:_ ~500 ml in a healthy adult.
    
- **Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV)**  
    The extra volume of air that can be forcibly inhaled after a normal inspiration (beyond tidal volume).  
    _Average:_ ~2500–3100 ml.
    
- **Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)**  
    The additional amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after a normal exhalation.  
    _Average:_ ~1200 ml.
    
- **Residual Volume (RV)**  
    The volume of air left in the lungs after maximal forced exhalation—this air cannot be voluntarily expelled.  
    _Average:_ ~1100–1200 ml.
    

## Lung Capacities

_These are combinations (sums) of the lung volumes described above._

- **Inspiratory Capacity (IC)**  
    Air volume that can be inhaled after a normal, quiet exhalation.  
    **Equation:** IC=TV+IRV\text{IC} = \text{TV} + \text{IRV}IC=TV+IRV  
    _Average:_ ~3600 ml.
    
- **Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)**  
    Air remaining in the lungs after a normal, passive exhalation. It represents the resting volume of the lungs.  
    **Equation:** FRC=ERV+RV\text{FRC} = \text{ERV} + \text{RV}FRC=ERV+RV  
    _Average:_ ~1800–2400 ml.
    
- **Vital Capacity (VC)**  
    The maximum amount of air that can be exhaled after a maximal inhalation. It measures the largest volume of breath a person can move.  
    **Equation:** VC=IRV+TV+ERV\text{VC} = \text{IRV} + \text{TV} + \text{ERV}VC=IRV+TV+ERV  
    _Average:_ ~4800 ml.
    
- **Total Lung Capacity (TLC)**  
    The total volume of air the lungs can hold after maximum inspiration. It includes all lung volumes.  
    **Equation:** TLC=IRV+TV+ERV+RV\text{TLC} = \text{IRV} + \text{TV} + \text{ERV} + \text{RV}TLC=IRV+TV+ERV+RV  
    _Average:_ ~6000 ml.
    

## Explanation of the Equations

- **IC = TV + IRV**  
    Inspiratory Capacity adds the normal breath volume to the additional air you can forcefully breathe in after that.
    
- **FRC = ERV + RV**  
    Functional Residual Capacity is the volume remaining after normal exhalation, combining air you can still forcefully breathe out plus the air that can't be pushed out.
    
- **VC = IRV + TV + ERV**  
    Vital Capacity measures the total air volume you can voluntarily move — from max inhale to max exhale.
    
- **TLC = IRV + TV + ERV + RV**  
    Total Lung Capacity includes _all_ the air in your lungs after maximum inhalation, including the air that stays in lungs no matter what.

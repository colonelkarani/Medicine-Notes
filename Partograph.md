A **partograph** (or partogram) is a _composite graphical record_ used to monitor key maternal and fetal parameters during labor over time, helping healthcare providers detect abnormalities early and intervene to prevent complications.

## What is a Partograph?

- It is a **single-sheet chart** that displays various observations recorded at regular intervals during labor plotted against time.
    
- Initially developed based on Friedman’s cervicography and later modified by Philpott and Castle (1972), it integrates the mother’s cervical dilation, fetal descent, uterine contractions, vital signs, and fetal condition to monitor labor progress comprehensively[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partogram)[2](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/5-2-monitoring-labour-and-delivery-51416957.html).
    
- The primary goal is to track the **progress of cervical dilation** and **fetal head descent** so that delays or abnormalities can be quickly recognized and acted upon[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partogram)[5](https://uomus.edu.iq/img/lectures21/MUCLecture_2025_13123188.pdf).
    

## Key Components and What They Measure

|Component|What is Measured|Purpose/Significance|
|---|---|---|
|**Patient Identification**|Name, gravida/para, medical history|To track individual patient records|
|**Time**|Hours from labor onset or admission|X-axis for plotting labor progress|
|**Cervical Dilation**|cm dilated (0-10 cm)|Monitors progress of labor; should progress ~1 cm/hr|
|**Fetal Head Descent**|Station in pelvis (e.g., -5 to +5 cm)|Indicates fetal progress through birth canal|
|**Uterine Contractions**|Frequency, duration, intensity|Assesses labor effectiveness|
|**Fetal Heart Rate**|Beats per minute (BPM)|Assesses fetal wellbeing; normal 110–160 bpm|
|**Amniotic Fluid**|Color (clear, meconium-stained, bloody)|Detects fetal distress or infection|
|**Maternal Vital Signs**|Pulse, blood pressure, temperature|Monitors mother’s condition and detects complications|
|**Urine Output & Analysis**|Volume, protein, ketones, glucose|Assesses hydration, metabolic state, and infection risks|
|**Medications/Fluids**|Oxytocin dosage, antibiotics, fluids|Records interventions|
|**Alert and Action Lines**|Graph lines indicating normal progress|Guide clinical decisions when labor deviates from normal[2](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/5-2-monitoring-labour-and-delivery-51416957.html)[5](https://uomus.edu.iq/img/lectures21/MUCLecture_2025_13123188.pdf)|

## How to Use the Partograph

- Record **initial cervical dilation and fetal station** at admission (often start plotting from 4 or 5 cm dilation and 3 contractions per 10 min)[2](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/5-2-monitoring-labour-and-delivery-51416957.html).
    
- Then plot **cervical dilation** hourly and fetal descent regularly against time to visualize labor progress.
    
- Monitor **uterine contractions**, fetal heart rate, and maternal vitals at recommended intervals to detect distress[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partogram)[5](https://uomus.edu.iq/img/lectures21/MUCLecture_2025_13123188.pdf).
    
- Use the **alert line** (representing 1 cm cervical dilation per hour) and the **action line** (usually 4 hours after the alert line) to determine if labor is slow or arrested[2](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/5-2-monitoring-labour-and-delivery-51416957.html).
    
- If the labor progress line crosses the **alert line**, closer monitoring or transfer may be needed. Crossing the **action line** signals the need for urgent interventions like augmentation or cesarean section[2](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/5-2-monitoring-labour-and-delivery-51416957.html).
    

## Clinical Importance

- The partograph helps in **early identification of prolonged or obstructed labor**, fetal distress, and maternal complications, enabling timely interventions to reduce risks of:
    
    - Maternal exhaustion, infection
        
    - Fetal hypoxia and stillbirth
        
    - Obstetric fistula and birth injuries[2](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/5-2-monitoring-labour-and-delivery-51416957.html)[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5783902/)[10](https://www.glowm.com/resource-type/resource/video/title/how-to-use-the-partograph/resource-doc/1135)
        
- It is widely used in hospitals and health centers and requires trained personnel to ensure accurate measurements and interpretation[3](https://www.open.edu/openlearncreate/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=272&printable=1)[4](https://www.contemporaryobgyn.net/view/who-partograph-beginner).
    

## Summary

The partograph is a vital monitoring tool in labor that graphically records and integrates:

- **Cervical dilation and fetal descent (labor progress)**
    
- **Maternal vital signs and well-being**
    
- **Fetal heart rate and amniotic fluid status**
    
- **Uterine contractions**
    

By comparing labor progress against standard alert and action lines, it guides clinical decisions to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partogram)[2](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/5-2-monitoring-labour-and-delivery-51416957.html)[5](https://uomus.edu.iq/img/lectures21/MUCLecture_2025_13123188.pdf).

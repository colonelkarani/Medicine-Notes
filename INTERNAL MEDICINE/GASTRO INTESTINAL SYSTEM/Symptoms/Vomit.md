When evaluating a patient who is vomiting, asking targeted questions helps to better characterize the vomit and narrow down potential causes. Here are the key questions to ask:

- **Onset and Duration:**
    
    - When did the vomiting start?
        
    - How long has it been going on?
        
- **Frequency and Amount:**
    
    - How many times have you vomited?
        
    - How much are you vomiting each time?
        
- **Content and Appearance:**
    
    - What does the vomit look like?
        
    - Is there blood (fresh or clotted), bile (greenish/yellow), or undigested food?[5](http://ksumsc.com/download_center/Archive/3rd/433/433%20Teams%20work/OSCE%20team/1st%20Semester/Stations/GI/1-Nausea,%20Vomiting,%20Apetite%20&%20Weight%20changes.pdf)[2](https://in2med.co.uk/lesson/vomiting/)[6](https://patient.info/digestive-health/nausea-and-vomiting)
        
- **Timing and Pattern:**
    
    - Is it occurring at a particular time of day (morning, night, after meals, unrelated to meals)?
        
- **Associated Symptoms:**
    
    - Is there nausea before vomiting?
        
    - Are there abdominal pain, fever, headache, or diarrhea?
        
    - Any recent weight loss, loss of appetite, or night sweats?[5](http://ksumsc.com/download_center/Archive/3rd/433/433%20Teams%20work/OSCE%20team/1st%20Semester/Stations/GI/1-Nausea,%20Vomiting,%20Apetite%20&%20Weight%20changes.pdf)[6](https://patient.info/digestive-health/nausea-and-vomiting)[2](https://in2med.co.uk/lesson/vomiting/)
        
- **Aggravating or Relieving Factors:**
    
    - Does anything make the vomiting worse or better?
        
- **Medical, Medication, and Social History:**
    
    - Are you taking any medications?
        
    - Do you have any underlying medical conditions?
        
    - Are you pregnant?
        
    - Do you drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs?
        
- **Recent Travel or Food Intake:**
    
    - Have you recently traveled or eaten out?
        
- **Other Red Flags:**
    
    - Are you unable to keep fluids down?
        
    - Are you becoming dehydrated (dry mouth, decreased urination, dizziness)?
        
    - Is there blood or bile in the vomit?
        
    - Is the vomiting projectile (very forceful)?[5](http://ksumsc.com/download_center/Archive/3rd/433/433%20Teams%20work/OSCE%20team/1st%20Semester/Stations/GI/1-Nausea,%20Vomiting,%20Apetite%20&%20Weight%20changes.pdf)[6](https://patient.info/digestive-health/nausea-and-vomiting)[2](https://in2med.co.uk/lesson/vomiting/)

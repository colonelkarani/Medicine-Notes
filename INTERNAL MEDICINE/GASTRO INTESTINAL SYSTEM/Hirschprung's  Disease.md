### Also aganglionic megacolon
## Definition

Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterized by the **absence of ganglion cells (aganglionosis) in the distal large intestine (colon)**, resulting in a functional obstruction and impaired movement of stool through the affected segment[1](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hirschsprungs-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20351556)[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview)[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung's_disease). This condition is present at birth and leads to significant difficulties in passing stool.

## Epidemiology

- **Incidence:** Hirschsprung’s disease occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 to 8,000 live births[2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hirschsprung-disease)[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview)[6](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9844-hirschsprung-disease).
    
- **Gender Predilection:** It is **more common in males,** with a male-to-female ratio of about 3–4:1 for short-segment disease; the ratio decreases with longer segment involvement[2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hirschsprung-disease)[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview)[6](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9844-hirschsprung-disease).
    
- **Race:** All races are affected, but the disease is more common among Asian-Americans[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview).
    
- **Age at Diagnosis:** Most cases (about 90%) are diagnosed in the newborn period, but rare cases may present in older children or adults[2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hirschsprung-disease)[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview).
    
- **Associated Conditions:** About 10% of cases are associated with Down syndrome. Other associated congenital anomalies may be present in up to 60% of patients[2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hirschsprung-disease)[4](https://geekymedics.com/hirschsprungs-disease/).

## Theories Around Development of Hirschsprung’s Disease

- **Neural Crest Migration:** The most widely accepted theory is that Hirschsprung’s disease results from a failure of neural crest cells to migrate completely into the distal bowel during embryonic development[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview)[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung's_disease).More proximal the arrest the  more severe the disease.
    
- **Genetic Factors:** Mutations in several genes have been implicated, including _RET_, _GDNF_, _GFRα1_, _NRTN_, _EDNRB_, _ET3_, _ZFHX1B_, _PHOX2b_, _SOX10_, and _SHH_. These genes are involved in the development and migration of neural crest cells[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview).
    
- **Other Mechanisms:** Defects in differentiation, proliferation, or survival of neuroblasts, or abnormal expression of extracellular matrix proteins and neurotrophic factors, may also contribute[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview)[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung's_disease).

## Classification of the Disease
### Based on length of affected segment
- **Short-Segment Hirschsprung’s Disease:** The **most common** form (about 80% of cases), where the aganglionic segment is limited to the rectum and sigmoid colon[2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hirschsprung-disease)[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview).
    
- **Long-Segment Hirschsprung’s Disease:** The aganglionic segment extends beyond the sigmoid colon, sometimes involving the entire colon or more rarely, the small intestine[2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hirschsprung-disease)[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview).
    
- **Total Colonic Aganglionosis:** Rare, involving the entire colon.
    
- **Ultra-Short Segment Disease:** Limited involvement just above the internal anal sphincter[2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hirschsprung-disease)[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23943250/).
### Based on clinical and syndromic associations
- **Syndromic associated  with Downs Syndrome or Wardenburg Syndrome**
- **Non syndromic cases**
### Based on histologic features
- **Variants:** Includes conditions like intestinal neuronal dysplasia,zonal agangliosis or segmental ,intestinal ganglioneuromatosis, isolated hypoganglionosis, and congenital smooth muscle cell disorders[3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23943250/).

## Pathophysiology

- **Absence of Ganglion Cells:** The primary defect is the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric (Auerbach) and submucosal (Meissner) plexuses of the distal colon[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview)[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung's_disease).
    
- **Functional Obstruction:** Lack of ganglion cells results in unopposed smooth muscle contraction and failure of relaxation, causing a functional obstruction[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview)[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung's_disease). Ganglion cells produce *Nitric oxide* and *Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP)* which are responsible for vasodilation and smooth muscle relaxation.
    
- **Proximal Bowel Distension:** The normally innervated proximal bowel becomes distended with stool, while the aganglionic segment remains narrow[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung's_disease).
    
- **Neural Crest Migration Defect:** The disorder is attributed to defective migration, differentiation, or survival of neural crest-derived cells during embryogenesis[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview)[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschsprung's_disease).
    
- **Genetic and Molecular Factors:** Mutations in genes critical for neural crest cell development disrupt normal innervation and motility[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview).
    


#### HIRSCHSPRUNG'S ASSOCIATED ENTEROCOLITIS (HAEC)
- This is a potential complication primarily due to microbiome dysbiosis in the proximal segment of the colon. Toxins and gases produced, disrupt the intestinal tight junctions allowing translocation of bacteria and result in an inflammatory reaction that allows infiltration of neutrophils as well as edema of the bowel, further worsening the impaction
- Blood supply will eventually be compromised resulting in ischemia, infarction and eventual necrosis of the bowel, and if untreated perforation may ensue.

## Clinical Presentation

- **Neonates:** The classic triad includes **failure to pass meconium within >72hrs, abdominal distension, and bilious vomiting***[4](https://geekymedics.com/hirschsprungs-disease/)[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview). Other symptoms may include irritability, feeding intolerance, and delayed passage of meconium[1](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hirschsprungs-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20351556)[4](https://geekymedics.com/hirschsprungs-disease/).
    
- **Older Children:** 
	- Chronic constipation since birth(requiring enema),
	- abdominal distension,
	- failure to thrive,
	- malnutrition, and 
	- lethargy[1](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hirschsprungs-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20351556)[4](https://geekymedics.com/hirschsprungs-disease/).
	- Episodes of enterocolitis; fever, , explosive foul smelling diarrhea, vomiting, septic shock
    
- **Complications:** Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is a severe, potentially life-threatening complication characterized by ==fever, abdominal tenderness, and bloody or foul-smelling diarrhea==[4](https://geekymedics.com/hirschsprungs-disease/)[6](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9844-hirschsprung-disease).

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical Suspicion:** Should be considered in any newborn who fails to pass meconium within 48 hours or has signs of intestinal obstruction[1](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hirschsprungs-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20351556)[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview).
    
- **Imaging:** Contrast enema may show a transition zone between the dilated proximal colon and the narrowed distal aganglionic segment[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview).
    
- **Rectal Biopsy:** The gold standard for diagnosis is a full-thickness rectal biopsy demonstrating the absence of ganglion cells[2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hirschsprung-disease)[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview).
    
- **Anorectal Manometry:** May be useful in older children with suspected ultrashort segment disease[2](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/hirschsprung-disease).
    
- **Genetic Testing:** May be considered in cases with a family history or associated syndromes[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview).

## Management

- **Surgical Treatment:** The mainstay of treatment is surgical removal of the aganglionic segment and restoration of bowel continuity (pull-through procedures such as Swenson, Duhamel, or Soave techniques)[5](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/178493-overview)[6](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9844-hirschsprung-disease).
    
- **Temporary Ostomy:** In severe cases or with complications (e.g., enterocolitis), a temporary colostomy or ileostomy may be required before definitive surgery[6](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9844-hirschsprung-disease).
    
- **Postoperative Care:** Long-term follow-up is essential to manage complications such as constipation, incontinence, and enterocolitis[6](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9844-hirschsprung-disease).
    
- **Medical Management:** Supportive care includes hydration, nutritional support, and management of complications. Antibiotics are used for enterocolitis[6](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9844-hirschsprung-disease).
    
- **Genetic Counseling:** Recommended for families with a history of Hirschsprung’s disease or associated syndromes[6](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9844-hirschsprung-disease).

### Cervical Cancer Overview

- Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women in developing countries and a major public health problem.
- It predominantly originates from the ectocervix (about 80% of cases) with the remaining 20% from the endocervix.
- The commonest histological type is **squamous cell carcinoma** (85-90%), with adenocarcinomas forming about 10-15%.
- Squamous cell carcinomas develop from the squamocolumnar junction and may be keratinizing or non-keratinizing; prognosis varies by type.
- Adenocarcinomas arise from glandular epithelium inside the endocervical canal.
- HPV infection is the key causative agent, particularly high-risk types (16, 18, etc.). Most HPV infections clear spontaneously, but persistent infection leads to neoplastic changes.

### Epidemiology and Risk Factors

- Cervical cancer is rare among virgins or sexually inactive women.
- Risk factors include early sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, male partners with multiple partners, HPV infection, immunosuppression (e.g., HIV infection), smoking, long-term use of oral contraceptives, and poor socioeconomic status.
- HIV-positive women are at increased risk due to immunosuppression and higher prevalence of persistent HPV infection.

### Pathology and Spread

- Gross types include exophytic (growing outward), ulcerative (ulcer formation), and infiltrative (expanding into tissues).
- The spread is by direct extension into adjacent tissues (vagina, parametrium, uterus), through lymphatics (parametrial, pelvic nodes), and late hematogenous spread (lungs, liver, bone).
- Lymph node involvement is a critical prognostic factor.

### Clinical Features

- Early stages may be asymptomatic or present with abnormal cervical cytology on screening.
- Symptoms of invasive cervical cancer include post-coital bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, dyspareunia, lower back pain, hematuria, or rectal bleeding.
- Pelvic examination may reveal a friable cervical growth that bleeds easily.

### Diagnosis and Screening

- Pap smear cytology is a highly effective screening method that reduces incidence and mortality by detecting pre-invasive lesions.
- Colposcopy with directed biopsy is used for diagnosis when cytology is abnormal.
- Other tests: HPV DNA testing, biopsy to confirm histologic type.
- FIGO staging relies heavily on clinical examination, supplemented by imaging (MRI for parametrial invasion and lymph node status).

### Staging (FIGO 2009)

- Stage I: Confined to cervix.
- Stage II: Beyond cervix but not to pelvic wall.
- Stage III: Extends to pelvic wall, lower vagina or causes hydronephrosis.
- Stage IV: Invades bladder, rectum or distant metastasis.

### Treatment

- Early-stage (IA1) microinvasive carcinoma may be treated with conization or simple hysterectomy.
- Radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is mainstay for stage IB and IIA.
- Advanced stages treated with chemoradiation (cisplatin-based) and external beam radiation plus brachytherapy.
- Fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy may be an option for small early tumors.
  
### Prognosis

- Depends on stage, tumor size, lymph node involvement, histology, grade, patient age, and HPV status.
- Five-year survival rates range from 90-100% in stage IA1 to about 20% in stage IV.
- HPV-positive younger women tend to have better prognosis.

### Prevention

- Primary prevention includes HPV vaccination and safe sexual practices.
- Secondary prevention involves regular cervical cancer screening (Pap smear, HPV testing).
- Regular surveillance and treatment of pre-invasive lesions (CIN) reduce progression to invasive cancer.

This detailed information about cervical cancer covers the pathology, epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical features, treatment, prognosis, and prevention strategies based on robust gynecological textbooks and clinical guidelines.[1][2][3]

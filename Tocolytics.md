## Additional Notes and Clinical Considerations:

- **Beta-2 agonists** (e.g., terbutaline) are effective but have significant maternal side effects including tachycardia, arrhythmias, and metabolic disturbances; their use is often limited to short periods (48-72 hours)[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10992278/)[7](https://www.drugs.com/drug-class/tocolytic-agents.html).
    
- **Nifedipine** is currently favored due to its oral administration, safety profile, and beneficial effects on uteroplacental blood flow[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5558344/).
    
- **Magnesium sulfate** has a dual role: tocolysis and neuroprotection of the fetus, especially below 32 weeks' gestation. Careful monitoring is essential to avoid toxicity[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5558344/)[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocolytic).
    
- **NSAIDs** like indomethacin are used cautiously due to risks to the fetus, primarily when used earlier than 32 weeks to avoid ductal constriction[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tocolytic).
    
- **Atosiban**, an oxytocin receptor antagonist, presents fewer systemic side effects and is recommended in some guidelines but may have cost and availability limitations[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10992278/).
    

## Summary:

Tocolytics aim to delay delivery chiefly to allow administration of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity and transfer to specialized care. They are used primarily between 24 and 34 weeks gestation in confirmed preterm labor, balancing efficacy with maternal-fetal safety. The choice of agent depends on clinical scenario, gestational age, contraindications, and side effect profiles.

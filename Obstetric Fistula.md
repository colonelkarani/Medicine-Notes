**Obstetric fistula** is a serious medical condition where a hole develops between a woman’s birth canal (vagina) and adjacent organs such as the bladder or rectum, usually as a result of prolonged, obstructed labor without timely medical intervention[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetric_fistula)[3](https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/10-facts-on-obstetric-fistula)[4](https://www.unfpa.org/obstetric-fistula). This abnormal opening causes continuous leakage of urine, feces, or both, leading to incontinence.

## Causes and Mechanism

- It mainly results from **prolonged obstructed labor**—when the baby cannot pass through the pelvis due to factors like a small or undeveloped maternal pelvis, large baby size, or poor fetal position.
    
- During labor, the baby’s head presses against the soft tissues of the vagina, bladder, or rectum for an extended time, cutting off blood supply (ischemia), causing tissue death (necrosis).
    
- The dead tissue then sloughs away, creating a hole (fistula) between the vagina and the urinary tract (vesicovaginal fistula) or rectum (rectovaginal fistula)[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetric_fistula)[5](https://fistulacare.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Training/Module_6_Obstetric_fistula_causes_and_factors_Fistula_Care.pdf)[6](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Obstetric_Fistula)[7](https://www.ics.org/committees/developingworld/publicawareness/obstetricfistulaanintroduction).
    

## Symptoms

- Continuous leaking of urine and/or feces through the vagina, causing constant wetness and foul odor.
    
- Repeated vaginal and urinary tract infections, irritation, pain, and discomfort.
    
- Psychological distress due to social stigma, isolation, and often abandonment by family or spouse.
    
- Other complications include infertility, stillbirth (which occurs in 85-100% of cases), pain during sex, ulcerations, and nerve damage leading to mobility problems[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetric_fistula)[3](https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/10-facts-on-obstetric-fistula)[6](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Obstetric_Fistula).
    

## Risk Factors

- Poor access to emergency obstetric care, especially cesarean sections.
    
- Teenage pregnancy and early marriage, leading to childbirth before the pelvis is fully developed.
    
- Malnutrition and poverty, which contribute to poor overall health and pelvic development.
    
- Lack of skilled birth attendance and harmful traditional practices[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetric_fistula)[3](https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/10-facts-on-obstetric-fistula)[5](https://fistulacare.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Training/Module_6_Obstetric_fistula_causes_and_factors_Fistula_Care.pdf)[7](https://www.ics.org/committees/developingworld/publicawareness/obstetricfistulaanintroduction)[8](https://catherinehamlin.org/what-is-obstetric-fistula/).
    

## Impact

- Obstetric fistula causes severe physical disabilities and enormous social challenges. Women often face depression, social isolation, and loss of livelihood.
    
- It is considered a disease of poverty and is prevalent mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Asia, and Latin America, with over 2 million women living with untreated fistula and approximately 50,000 to 100,000 new cases annually[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetric_fistula)[3](https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/10-facts-on-obstetric-fistula)[4](https://www.unfpa.org/obstetric-fistula)[6](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Obstetric_Fistula)[8](https://catherinehamlin.org/what-is-obstetric-fistula/).
    

## Prevention and Treatment

- **Prevention** hinges on timely access to quality obstetric care, including cesarean sections during obstructed labor, delaying age at first pregnancy, and ending harmful cultural practices.
    
- **Treatment** is primarily surgical repair of the fistula. Early cases may heal with catheterization alone. Counseling and social reintegration support are crucial for recovery[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstetric_fistula)[3](https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/10-facts-on-obstetric-fistula)[4](https://www.unfpa.org/obstetric-fistula)[5](https://fistulacare.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Training/Module_6_Obstetric_fistula_causes_and_factors_Fistula_Care.pdf).
    

In summary, obstetric fistula is a preventable childbirth injury caused by prolonged obstructed labor, resulting in devastating physical, social, and psychological consequences for affected women. Improving maternal healthcare access is key to ending this condition.

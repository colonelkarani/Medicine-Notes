The **uterus** is a central organ of the female reproductive system, located in the pelvis between the bladder anteriorly and the rectum posteriorly. It is a hollow, thick-walled, pear-shaped muscular organ designed to support reproduction, including menstruation, implantation of a fertilized egg, fetal development, and labor[](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22467-uterus)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus)[](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/uterus).

## 1. Anatomy and Structure

The uterus measures about **7-8 cm in length, 4-5 cm in width, and 3-4 cm in thickness** in its non-pregnant state and typically weighs around **60 grams** (approximately 1-2 ounces)[](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22467-uterus)[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470297/)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus)[](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/uterus). During pregnancy, it can stretch dramatically, expanding from a lemon-size to a watermelon-size organ, weighing up to 2 pounds at full term[](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22467-uterus).

The uterus is divided into **four main anatomical regions**:

|Region|Description|
|---|---|
|**Fundus**|The dome-shaped, uppermost portion above the fallopian tube openings. It is the broadest part.|
|**Body (Corpus)**|The main muscular part extending from the fundus to the isthmus. The endometrial cavity lies here.|

| **Isthmus / Lower Uterine Segment** | Narrow region connecting the body to the cervix; thins and expands during pregnancy to facilitate labor and common site for cesarean incision. |  
| **Cervix** | The fibrous, cylindrical lower part projecting into the vagina. Contains the cervical canal from internal os to external os. |

## 2. Layers of the Uterine Wall

The uterus consists of three distinct layers:

- **Endometrium (Innermost layer):** The mucous membrane lining the uterine cavity that undergoes cyclical changes during the menstrual cycle. It thickens under hormonal influence and is shed during menstruation if no pregnancy occurs. This layer is critical for embryo implantation[](https://geekymedics.com/anatomy-of-the-uterus/).
    
- **Myometrium (Middle layer):** Thick, smooth muscle layer arranged in longitudinal, circular, and oblique fibers. This muscular layer supports strong contractions during labor to expel the fetus and controls menstruation-related shedding[](https://geekymedics.com/anatomy-of-the-uterus/)[](https://www.glowm.com/section-view/heading/clinical-anatomy-of-the-uterus-fallopian-tubes-and-ovaries/item/1).
    
- **Perimetrium (Outermost layer):** A thin serous layer derived from peritoneum covering the outside of the uterus, offering protection and support[](https://geekymedics.com/anatomy-of-the-uterus/).
    

## 3. Position and Support

- The uterus is normally positioned **anteverted and anteflexed**, meaning it tilts forward toward the bladder. Variations include retroverted or retroflexed uteri, which are less common and usually asymptomatic[](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22467-uterus)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus).
    
- It is held in position by multiple ligaments and pelvic fascia, including the **broad ligament** (a peritoneal fold), **round ligaments**, **uterosacral ligaments**, **cardinal ligaments**, and **pubocervical ligaments**, providing stability and support within the pelvis[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus)[](https://www.glowm.com/section-view/heading/clinical-anatomy-of-the-uterus-fallopian-tubes-and-ovaries/item/1).
    

## 4. Function

- **Menstruation:** The uterus sheds its endometrial lining monthly in the absence of fertilization, regulated by hormonal cycles.
    
- **Reproduction and Pregnancy:** The uterus provides the site for implantation of the fertilized egg in the endometrium, supports embryonic and fetal development, and accommodates the growing fetus through considerable expansion.
    
- **Labor:** Powerful myometrial contractions facilitate the expulsion of the fetus during childbirth.
    
- **Postpartum:** After delivery, the uterus undergoes involution, returning to its pre-pregnancy size within about six weeks[](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22467-uterus).
    

## 5. Blood Supply and Innervation

- Blood supply is primarily from the **uterine arteries**, branches of the internal iliac arteries, anastomosing with the ovarian arteries.
    
- Venous drainage generally parallels arterial supply via uterine veins.
    
- Innervation involves sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers contributing to uterine contractility and pain sensation during menstruation and labor[](https://teachmeanatomy.info/pelvis/female-reproductive-tract/uterus/)[](https://www.glowm.com/section-view/heading/clinical-anatomy-of-the-uterus-fallopian-tubes-and-ovaries/item/1).
    

## 6. Clinical Notes

- The **lower uterine segment** develops late in pregnancy and is the preferred site for lower segment cesarean sections because it is thinner and heals better.
    
- Congenital anomalies can occur from improper fusion of the Müllerian ducts in fetal development, causing uterine malformations (e.g., bicornuate, septate uterus), which may impact fertility or pregnancy outcomes[](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22467-uterus).
    
- Common uterine conditions include fibroids (leiomyomas), adenomyosis, endometriosis, polyps, and cancers affecting uterine health and function.
    

This comprehensive understanding of the uterus highlights its critical role in female reproductive health, from menstruation to childbirth, supported by its specialized anatomy, layered structure, and dynamic physiological capabilities.

The **uterus** can be divided into several anatomical segments based on their structure and function:

|Segment|Description|
|---|---|
|**Fundus**|The rounded, uppermost part of the uterus above the openings of the fallopian tubes. It is the widest area and is involved in uterine contractions during labor.|
|**Corpus (Body)**|The main muscular portion of the uterus between the fundus and the isthmus. It contains most of the uterine muscle (myometrium) and the endometrial lining where implantation occurs.|
|**Isthmus / Lower Uterine Segment (LUS)**|A narrow region between the corpus and the cervix, about 1 cm long in non-pregnant state. In pregnancy, this segment thins and stretches significantly, forming the lower uterine segment. It connects the body to the cervix. This segment is less muscular and more fibrous, important in labor and commonly the site for cesarean incisions.|
|**Cervix**|The narrow, lower part of the uterus that projects into the vagina. It comprises the **supravaginal portion** (above the vagina) and the **vaginal portion** (which can be seen on vaginal examination). The cervical canal communicates with the uterine cavity above (internal os) and the vagina below (external os). It plays a key role in dilation during labor.|

Additional points:

- The uterus is normally **anteverted** (tilted forward) and **anteflexed** (the body bends forward over the cervix) in most females.
    
- Each segment has distinctive histological features; for example, the corpus contains abundant muscular tissue for contractions, whereas the cervix has more fibrous connective tissue.
    
- During pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester, the **isthmus expands to form the lower uterine segment**, which thins to help with labor by allowing dilation and passage of the fetus.
    

In summary, the uterine segments from top to bottom are Fundus → Corpus (body) → Isthmus/Lower Uterine Segment → Cervix, each with specialized anatomy and function relevant to reproduction and childbirth[6](https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/the-uterus)[1](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22467-uterus)[9](https://geekymedics.com/anatomy-of-the-uterus/).

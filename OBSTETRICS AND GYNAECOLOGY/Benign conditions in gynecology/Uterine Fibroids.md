Smooth muscle tumor of the uterus

### Epidemiology
30% women >30 years symptomatic 30%

- Age 
	- 30-40yrs
- Common in nulliparas
- Race 
	- 3-9 times more likely in blacks
- Positive Family History

Hyper- estrogenimea
- Estrogen receptors more in myometrium but less in endometrium
- Associated with other conditions such as endometriosis, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial carcinoma
### Location of fibroids
The fibroids into two main categories by location:

1. **Uterine Fibroids [99%]**  
    These fibroids are located within the uterus, making up 99% of all fibroids. They are further divided into:
    
    - **Corporeal (95%)**: These refer to fibroids inside the main body of the uterus. Corporeal fibroids are the majority. Within corporeal fibroids, there are three subtypes based on their position in the uterine wall:
        
        - **Interstitial (60%)**: Fibroids located within the muscular wall of the uterus.
            
        - **Submucous (20%)**: Fibroids that grow just underneath the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) and can protrude into the uterine cavity. These often cause symptoms like heavy bleeding.
            
        - **Subserous (15%)**: Fibroids growing on the outer surface of the uterus, under the outer membrane called the serosa.
            
    - **Cervical (4%)**: These fibroids occur in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina.
        
2. **Extrauterine Fibroids [1%]**  
    Fibroids located outside the uterus, either on the genital organs or elsewhere in the body.
    
    - **Genital**: Fibroids related to genital organs (specific subtypes are not listed on the slide).
        
    - **Extragenital** (outside genital organs):
        
        - **Parasitic Fibroid**: Fibroids that grow outside the uterus and attach themselves to other structures/organs to get blood supply.
            
        - **Others**: This category likely includes rare or miscellaneous types of extrauterine fibroids.

## Characteristics of uterine fibroids
1. Size
2. Shape
3. Cut 
4. Consistency
	1. Soft
		- Pregnancy
		- Cystic Changes
		- Vascular
		- Inflammatory
		- Malignant
	2. Hard
		- Calcification
5. Capsule
	- Differentiates myoma from adenomyosis
6. Blood Supply

## History
### Presentations
- Asymptomatic
	- Common in subserous and interstitial fibroids
- **Vaginal Bleeding** commonest symptom
	- Menorrhagia due to
		- hormonal imbalance and endometrial hyperplasia
		- Sub-mucus - surface ulceration
		- Interstitial prevent full contraction of myometrium
		- Increases uterine size vascularity
	- Metrorrhagia (bleeding btn periods)
		- ulceration, necrosis, secondary infection
		- Associated endometrial polyp or malignancy
	- Ulcerated or infected tip
	- Post menopausal bleeding
- Iron Deficiency Anaemia
- Discharge
	- Mucoid discharge - pelvic congestion
	- Mucosanguinous discharge - ulcerated polyp
	- Muco- purulent discharge- secondary infection
- Swelling
	- Abdominal - Large swelling
	- Vaginal - Polyp
- Infertility
	- Underlying anovulation and hormonal disturbance
	- Obstruction
	- Implantation - submucosal fibroids
- Pain (uncommon)
	- Acute abdomen in red degenereation
	- Dull aching pain - Pelvic congestion
	- Intermitetnt colicky pain in submucous fibroid
- Pressure Symptoms
	- Cervical
		- Retention of urine
		- Increased frequency of micturition
		- Back pressure on kidneys
		- Constipation
		- Sense of incomplete defacation
	- Huge Fibroids
		- Pelvic veins - Edema, pain, varicose veins
		- GIT - dyspepsia, distention
		- Diaphgram- dyspnea
- Spntaneous Abortion

### Secondary change in fibroids
- Degenerative changes
	- Hyaline degeneration
		- Starts at the **center** of the fibroid
		- Looks waxy ,soft 
	- Fatty changes
		- Starts at the **periphery**
		- Yellow soft fibroid
	- Calcification
		- After fatty change when they undergo saponification (hard like a bone)
	- Red degeneration
		- Middle trimester of **pregnancy**
		- Tumor enlarges with hemorrhage inside the tumor
		- Necrobiosis (dead - central, living - peripheral)
	- Atrophic changes
		- Estrogen withdrawal
			- Menopause
			- Puerperium
	- Myxomatous changes
		- Near menopause 
		- Center of myoma forms mucoid material
	- Pseudo cystic changes

- Vascular changes
	- Torsion
		- Pedunculated subserous fibroids
		- Precipitated by movement : trauma, intestines, fetal kick
		- Acute abdomen and necrosis of the tumor
	- TElangectasia
		- Increases vascularity
			- pregnancy
			- Malignancy
			- Cervical fibroid
		- Rupture leads to acute abdomen and internal hemorrhage
	- Lymphangectasia
		- Fibroid full of lymphatics
			- Around menopause
		- Rupture leads to lymphatic exudates
	- Congestion and edema
- Inflammatory changes
	- Infection via
		- Nearby infection eg appendicitis
		- Trauma maybe due to labor
	- Becomes congestes tender or may form absess
	- Becomes soft and heals by adhesions
- Malignant Changes
	- Symptoms suggestive
		- Growth, post menopausal bleeding, more pain
		- Signs suggestive
			- Rapid growth, soft, tender,  fixed

## Examination and labs
- General examination
	- Signs of chronic anaemia
- Abdominal examination
	- Large Swelling
- Pelvic Examination
	- Symetric or asymetric enlarged uterus
- Speculum Examination
	- Pedunculated fibroid

## Differentials
### Symmetrically enlarged uterus
- Pregnancy
- Sub involution of the uterus
- Carcinoma, Sarcoma
- Submucosal, interstitial
### Asymmetrically enlarged uterus
- Subserous fibroid
- Localised adenomyosis
- Ligament swelling
- Pregnany in rudimentary horn

## Management
- Conservative
	- Small asymptomatic, in pregnancy or puerperium
	- Every 6 months observation
	- Check pathology
- Medical 
	- pre-op til surgery
	- Red degeneration with pregnancy
	- Preop till surgery

- Symptomatic
	- correct anaemia,hemostatics, analsesics &antispasmodics
- Anti- estrogens
	- Large dose of progesterone
	- Tamoxifen, Danazol
	- LH, RH analogues - decrease size and vascualrity of the tumor
- Surgery (myomectomy or hysterectomy)
	- Indications
		- Inferility
		- Symptomatic or >12wks uterus
		- Multiple huge fibroids
	- Types of myomectomy
		- Abdominal
		- Vaginal
		- Endoscopic
		- Embolization techniques
	- Precautions
		- Time is post menstrual
		- preop LH -RH analogues 
		- Keep blood ready

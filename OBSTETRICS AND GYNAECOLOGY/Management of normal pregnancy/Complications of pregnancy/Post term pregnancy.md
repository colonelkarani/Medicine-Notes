# Define , classify and describe the epidemiology of post-term pregnancy

Post-term pregnancy is a pregnancy that has extended to or beyond:    

- 42 completed weeks (42 0/7 weeks or 294 days) of gestation from the first  day of the last normal menstrual period (WHO, ACOG, FIGO)

- 40 completed weeks (40 0/7 weeks or 280 days) of gestation from the date of  conception

It occurs in about 0.5-10% of all pregnancies more incidences in Sweden and in France

# Correctly establish gestational age and diagnose postterm pregnancy

We use Naegeles rule to correctly check the gestational age
Others include
- Ultrasound
- Fundal Height
- Quickening

In the history ask about
- Preconception menstrual cycles
- Contraception
- Early pregnancy bleeding
- Method and date of conception

In examination we look at
- Fundal Height

In ultrasound we look at 
- BPD
- CRL
- HC
- AC
- FL (femur length)


#### Classifying gestational age

| preterm    | <28-37wks 4*3          |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| early term | 37^1/7wks - 38 ^6/7wks |
| full term  | 39wks- 40^6/7wks       |
| late term  | 41wks-41^6/7wks        |
| post term  | >42wks                 |
# Describe the risk factors for postterm pregnancy

Risk factors for post term pregnacy are:
- Nulliparity
- Previous post term pregnancy
- Multiple Gestations
- Male infant
- Family History
- Fetal conditions like chromosomal anomalies and anencephaly

# Understand the maternal, fetal and neonatal risks/complications of  postterm pregnancy

## Maternal
- Prolonged stay in hospital
- Risk of CS or operative vaginal deliveries
- Risk of PPH, bleeding
- Severe perineal lacerations
	1. Perineal sphincter
	2. + perineal muscles
	3. +anal sphincter internal
	4. + anal sphincter externa;


## Fetal
- Risk of macrosomia
- FHR abnormalities, IUGR
- Oligohydramnios
- Mesonium Aspiration Syndrome
- Shoulder dystocia
- Umbilical Cord compression

## Neonatal
-  The lungs are affected by meconium aspiration - chemical pneumonitis
- Poor growth
- Neonatal convulsions
-  < APGAR score


**POST MATURITY SYNDROME**  -  
- Decreased subcutaneous fat
- Lack of vernix
- Meconium staining


# Outline and rationalize the approaches to appropriate management of  postterm pregnancy

### Induction of labor  **41-42wks**
Can be medical or can be mechanical
Twins are delivered earlier **38wks**
#### Indications for induction of labor
- PROM
- Fetal demise
- Medical conditions
- Post term pregnancy
- FGR
- Placenta abruptio
###### Mechanical
Membrane sweeping
Foley Catheter
Amniotomy or artificial rupture of membranes
Nipple stimulation

###### Medical
Oxytocin
Prostaglandin analogues eg misoprostol
Prostaglandin receptor antagonists eg mifepristone
Estrogen


#### Bishops score for cervical ripening
- cervical dilatation
- effacement
- position
- consistency
- Station

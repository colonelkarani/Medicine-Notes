**Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG)** is a severe pregnancy complication characterized by **extreme, persistent nausea and vomiting**, leading to **dehydration, weight loss**, and electrolyte imbalances. It is considered a more serious and debilitating form of typical morning sickness.

## 1. **Causes and Risk Factors**

- The exact cause of HG is not fully understood but is strongly linked to **rapidly rising pregnancy hormones**, especially:
    
    - **Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)**, which peaks around 10 weeks gestation.
        
    - **Estrogen**, which also increases during pregnancy.
        
- Genetic factors may play a role, with family history increasing risk.
    
- Other risk factors include:
    
    - **First pregnancy**
        
    - Multiple pregnancy (twins or more)
        
    - Molar pregnancy (gestational trophoblastic disease)
        
    - History of HG in previous pregnancies
        
    - Carrying a female fetus
        
    - Younger maternal age
        
    - Obesity
        
- Recent research suggests a link to elevated **growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15)** and increased sensitivity to it.
    

## 2. **Symptoms**

- Severe and persistent nausea and vomiting, often multiple times daily
    
- Inability to retain food or fluids leading to:
    
    - **Weight loss (>5% of body weight)**
        
    - Signs of **dehydration**: dry skin, dark urine, weakness, dizziness, fainting
        
    - **Electrolyte imbalances** such as low potassium or sodium
        
- Excessive salivation
    
- Fatigue and weakness
    
- Possible complications include throat irritation or bleeding from repetitive vomiting
    
- Symptoms usually start in the **first trimester (around 6 weeks)** and often peak at 9-10 weeks but can persist longer, sometimes throughout pregnancy
    

## 3. **Diagnosis**

- Based mainly on clinical presentation:
    
    - Severe vomiting >3 times/day
        
    - Weight loss >5% of prepregnancy weight
        
    - Presence of ketones in urine (ketonuria)
        
- Exclusion of other causes of vomiting (gastrointestinal disorders, urinary tract infection, hyperthyroidism, etc.)
    
- Lab tests to assess electrolyte disturbances, dehydration, ketones, and thyroid function may be needed.
    

## 4. **Complications**

- Maternal complications:
    
    - Malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies (especially thiamine deficiency risking Wernicke’s encephalopathy)
        
    - Electrolyte imbalance and dehydration
        
    - Psychological stress and impact on quality of life
        
- Fetal risks:
    
    - Low birth weight
        
    - Preterm birth
        
    - Some studies suggest possible long-term effects on offspring due to severe maternal illness and poor nutrition
        

## 5. **Treatment**

Aimed at symptom relief, prevention of dehydration, and maintaining adequate nutrition:

## a) Supportive Care

- **Hospitalization** may be required for severe cases to provide:
    
    - **Intravenous fluids** (Ringer’s lactate initially)
        
    - Replacement of electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, phosphate)
        
    - **Thiamine supplementation** prior to glucose to prevent Wernicke’s encephalopathy
        
- Temporary cessation of oral intake, gradual reintroduction of food and fluids
    

## b) Medications

- **Antiemetics** safe in pregnancy such as:
    
    - Pyridoxine (vitamin B6)
        
    - Doxylamine
        
    - Metoclopramide
        
    - Promethazine or prochlorperazine
        
    - Ondansetron if others fail (with caution; some guidelines vary)
        
- Corticosteroids may be used if other treatments fail
    
- Multiple medications may be tried in combination for better control
    

## c) Nutritional Support

- Small, frequent meals once vomiting lessens
    
- Vitamin and mineral supplementation
    
- Some severe cases may require **total parenteral nutrition (TPN)** if oral or enteral feeding isn't possible
    

## 6. **Prognosis**

- Most women improve by Weeks 14–20 of pregnancy although symptoms can persist longer.
    
- With modern treatment, severe complications are rare.
    
- Women with prior HG are at increased risk in future pregnancies.

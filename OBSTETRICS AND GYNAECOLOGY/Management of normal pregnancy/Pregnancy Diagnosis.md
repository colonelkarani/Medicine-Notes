# Diagnosis of Pregnancy, Estimation of Fetal Maturity, Detection of Fetal Abnormalities, and Tests for Fetal Wellbeing

## 1. Diagnosis of Pregnancy

## Clinical Assessment

- **History & Symptoms:**
    
    - **Missed menstrual period** (amenorrhea) is usually the first indicator of pregnancy.
        
    - Other early symptoms: 
	    - breast enlargement/tenderness,
		    - hyperpigmentation of the areola(Montigomeries tubercles)
		     ![maternal-changes-during-pregnancy-for-undergraduate-8-638.jpg (638×479)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi14DSUfYdInCCExrXoCfroH8cNr7P10AyRJMEPiDzAvucbCcEdJFpDqOaXCOj0XFuF9Eg1_G0zHJ3gX_VE5SxvJu-FHsrm_XXlmiBxF_FHmXDonN6K0ZmaX7QwAAqJFslDQJgXRH9ywVup/s1600/maternal-changes-during-pregnancy-for-undergraduate-8-638.jpg)
	    - nausea/vomiting(hyperemesis gravidarum), 
	    - uterine changes (hedgars sign)
		    ![_.png (1920×1438)](https://d16qt3wv6xm098.cloudfront.net/XVC15LVpRiaZkxUIyQZGvl11Tm6kKXep/_.png)
	    - Vaginal changes(bluish discoloration - chadwicks sign)
	    - ![lzyzRE4nrE332yc2KaW1rQ.jpg (500×375)](https://o.quizlet.com/lzyzRE4nrE332yc2KaW1rQ.jpg)
	    - constipation
        
    - Later signs: 
	    - noticeable uterine enlargement,
	    - perception of fetal movements (quickening), 
	    - skin changes (e.g., linea nigra,chloasma gravidarum, striae gravidarum, telangectasia),
	    - fetal heart sounds[1](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/1-1-diagnosing-pregnancy-51415897.html)[2](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/servicesandsupport/pregnancy-tests-and-scans).
	    - Backache
        
- **Physical Examination:**
    
    - Changes in the cervix, uterus, and vaginal mucosa can be noted during a pelvic exam.
        
    - Progressive enlargement of the uterus from 7-8 weeks post-last menstrual period[1](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/1-1-diagnosing-pregnancy-51415897.html).
    - Palpation of fetal movements
- DIfferential DIagnosos
	- amennorhea

## Laboratory Tests

- **Urine Tests:**
    
    - Detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) in urine through home or office test kits, usually positive by the time of a missed period[2](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/servicesandsupport/pregnancy-tests-and-scans).
        
- **Blood Tests:**
    
    - Measurement of βhCG in blood, which can detect pregnancy about 7-10 days after conception; more sensitive and can quantify hormone concentration[2](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/servicesandsupport/pregnancy-tests-and-scans).

|Method|Sample Type|Detection Principle|Use|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**IA (Immunoassay)**|Urine|Antibody-based detection|Home pregnancy tests|Qualitative, easy & fast|
|**RIA (Radioimmunoassay)**|Serum (blood)|Antibodies labeled with radioisotopes|Sensitive quantitative lab test|Radioactive, older method|
|**RRA (Radioreceptor Assay)**|Serum (blood)|Radioactive ligand-receptor binding|Quantitative lab test|Rare now, uses hormone receptors|
|**ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)**|Serum or urine|Enzyme-labeled antibodies cause color change|Quantitative lab test|Modern standard, no radioactivity| 

## Imaging

- **Transvaginal Ultrasound:**
    
    - Detects gestational sac as early as 4-5 weeks after last menstrual period.
        
    - Visual confirmation of pregnancy, assessment of location, and differentiation between normal, abnormal, or extrauterine pregnancies[3](https://www.glowm.com/section-view/heading/The%20Diagnosis%20of%20Pregnancy/item/93)[1](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/1-1-diagnosing-pregnancy-51415897.html).
        

## 2. Estimation of Fetal Maturity

## Clinical Methods

- **Last Menstrual Period (LMP):**
    
    - Gestational age is often estimated from the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period.
        
    - Naegeles Rule 
    - The calculation is done by:
		
		1. Starting from the first day of the last menstrual period.
		2. **Subtracting 3 months**
		3. **Adding 7 days**.
		4. **Adding 1 year**.
        
- **Physical Examination:**
    
    - Symphysis-fundal height,
    ![how-to-measure-fundal-height-at-home.jpg (755×759)](https://adatewithbaby.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-to-measure-fundal-height-at-home.jpg)
    - abdominal palpation, and tracking fetal movements can offer crude estimates.
        

## Ultrasound Assessment

- **First Trimester:**
    
    - Measurement of the crown-rump length (CRL) between 7 and 13 weeks is highly accurate (±6 days).
- ![Crown-Rump-Length-Chart-And-Measurement-1.jpg.webp (1200×1350)](https://cdn2.momjunction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Crown-Rump-Length-Chart-And-Measurement-1.jpg.webp)
        
- **Second Trimester:**
    
    - Biometric parameters: biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length.
        
    - Accuracy is ±8 days between 12-22 weeks.
        
- **Third Trimester:**
    
    - Ultrasound is less accurate (confidence interval ±2-3 weeks), but still useful for growth and maturity assessment[4](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/259269-overview).

## Biochemical & Other Assessments

- **Amniotic Fluid Analysis:**
    
    - Tests for fetal lung maturity: measurement of surfactant proteins, lamellar body count, and L/S ratio when preterm delivery is considered.
        
- **Ossification Centers:**
    
    - Visualization of distal femoral epiphysis (>32-33 weeks) and proximal tibial epiphysis (>35 weeks) are signs of fetal maturity on ultrasound[4](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/259269-overview)[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3684248/).
        

## 3. Detection of Fetal Abnormalities

## Non-Invasive Screening

- **Maternal Serum Markers:**
    
    - First and second trimester maternal blood tests (e.g., alpha-fetoprotein, hCG, estriol, inhibin A) screen for chromosomal abnormalities and neural tube defects.
        
- **Ultrasound Screening (Anomaly Scan):**
    
    - Done especially between 18–22 weeks to detect structural abnormalities (e.g., cardiac defects, neural tube defects, limb anomalies)[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3232499/)[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1751721418301520).
        

## Specialized Tests

- **Cell-Free Fetal DNA (cfDNA) Testing:**
    
    - Non-invasive screening for common chromosomal disorders from maternal blood[8](https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/detection-of-genetic-disorders-before-and-during-pregnancy/prenatal-testing-for-genetic-disorders-and-birth-defects).
        
- **Amniocentesis:**
    
    - Performed around 15–20 weeks, involves sampling amniotic fluid to identify chromosomal, genetic, and some structural anomalies. Useful for women over age 35 or with abnormal screening results[8](https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/detection-of-genetic-disorders-before-and-during-pregnancy/prenatal-testing-for-genetic-disorders-and-birth-defects)
    ![ImageForArticle_22451_16516736137479814.jpg (2000×983)](https://d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net/image-handler/ts/20220504101334/ri/2000/src/images/Article_Images/ImageForArticle_22451_16516736137479814.jpg)
        
- **Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS):**
    
    - Performed at 10–13 weeks, analyzes placental tissue for chromosomal or genetic disorders[8](https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/detection-of-genetic-disorders-before-and-during-pregnancy/prenatal-testing-for-genetic-disorders-and-birth-defects)[9](https://www.nhsinform.scot/healthy-living/screening/pregnancy/diagnostic-tests-in-pregnancy/).

- **Targeted Fetal MRI:**
    
    - Used in specialized cases where more detail is needed, such as central nervous system anomalies[6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3232499/).

## Conclusion

Comprehensive care in pregnancy involves timely and appropriate application of diagnostic tests, imaging, screening, and monitoring techniques. These strategies collectively enable early diagnosis, accurate estimation of fetal age, prompt detection of anomalies, and optimal surveillance of fetal wellbeing, improving maternal and neonatal outcomes[14](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/262591-overview)[2](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/servicesandsupport/pregnancy-tests-and-scans)[4](https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/259269-overview).

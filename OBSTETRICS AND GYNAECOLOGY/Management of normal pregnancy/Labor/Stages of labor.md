The **four stages of labor** describe the process a woman goes through during childbirth. Here’s a detailed overview based on medical sources:

## 1. First Stage: Dilation of the Cervix

- Begins with the **onset of regular uterine contractions** and ends when the **cervix is fully dilated to about 10 centimeters**.
    
- It is the longest stage and is divided into three phases:
    
    - **Early (latent) phase:** Mild, irregular contractions; cervix dilates from 0 to about 3 cm.The mucus plug may be discharged ("show") and water breaking may occur. 
	    - **Prolonged latent phase>8hrs**
        
    - **Active phase:** Stronger, more frequent contractions every 2–3 minutes; cervix dilates from about 3 to 8 cm. The baby’s head moves further down into the pelvis.
	    - **Prolonged active phase>12 hrs**
        
    - **Transitional phase:** Intense contractions every 2–3 minutes, lasting about a minute; cervix dilates from 8 to 10 cm, which is fully dilated and ready for delivery. This phase is often the most difficult physically.
        

## 2. Second Stage: Delivery of the Baby

- This stage starts once the cervix is fully dilated and ends with the birth of the baby.
    
- Contractions continue, and you actively push to help the baby move through the birth canal.
    
- The baby moves down through the pelvis and is delivered.
- Prolonged Second Stage 
	- primigravida >2hrs
	- multigravida >1hr
    

## 3. Third Stage: Delivery of the Placenta (Afterbirth)

- After the baby is born, the uterus continues to contract, which helps detach and expel the placenta through the vagina.
    
- This typically happens within 5 to 30 minutes after birth.
    
- This stage may be managed actively (with medication like oxytocin to speed contractions) or physiologically (naturally).
    

## 4. Fourth Stage: Recovery

- This stage lasts about 1 to 2 hours after delivery.
    
- It's a critical period when the mother’s body starts to recover—uterus contracts back toward its pre-pregnancy size, bleeding is monitored, and any necessary repair of tears or incisions is done.
    
- The baby is monitored, often placed skin-to-skin on the mother’s chest, and breastfeeding is usually initiated during this time.
    

**Summary Table for the 4 Stages of Labor:**

|Stage|Description|Key Points|
|---|---|---|
|1st Stage (Dilation)|Cervix thins and opens from 0 to 10 cm|Longest stage, 3 phases: early, active, transition|
|2nd Stage (Delivery)|Baby moves through birth canal and is born|Pushing phase, ends with baby’s birth|
|3rd Stage (Placenta)|Placenta is expelled|Lasts minutes up to ~30, active or natural management|
|4th Stage (Recovery)|Mother recovers after delivery|Monitoring, uterine contraction, initiating bonding and feeding|

These stages reflect the natural progression of labor and delivery, and healthcare providers support the mother throughout each stage to ensure safety for both mother and baby.

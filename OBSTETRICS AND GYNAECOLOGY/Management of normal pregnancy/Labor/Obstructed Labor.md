**Obstructed labor** is a serious obstetric condition occurring during childbirth when **the baby fails to descend through the birth canal despite adequate uterine contractions** because of a physical blockage or mismatch between the fetal size or position and the maternal pelvis or birth canal[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9499287/)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructed_labour)[8](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Obstructed_labour).

## Key Points:

- **Definition:** Labor that does not progress despite strong uterine contractions because the baby’s head or body is too large, malpositioned, or the maternal pelvis/birth canal is too small or obstructed[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9499287/)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructed_labour)[9](https://www.gfmer.ch/Obstetrics_simplified/obstructed_labour.htm).
    
- **Causes:**
    
    - **Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD):** The baby’s head or body is too large relative to the mother’s pelvis size or shape (e.g., contracted pelvis)[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9499287/)[6](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/1obstructed-labor/142625982)[7](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/obstructed-labor/24693514)[9](https://www.gfmer.ch/Obstetrics_simplified/obstructed_labour.htm).
        
    - **Malposition or malpresentation:** Abnormal fetal positions such as shoulder dystocia (antero-posterior shoulder stuck behind pubic bone), transverse lie, breech, or persistent occiput posterior[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructed_labour)[9](https://www.gfmer.ch/Obstetrics_simplified/obstructed_labour.htm).
        
    - **Birth canal abnormalities:** Narrow or scarred vagina or perineum (sometimes due to female genital mutilation), tumors obstructing the canal[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructed_labour)[9](https://www.gfmer.ch/Obstetrics_simplified/obstructed_labour.htm).
        
    - **Risk factors:** Adolescence (pelvis not fully mature), malnutrition and vitamin D deficiency leading to pelvic deformities, prior pelvic injuries, or uterine abnormalities[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructed_labour)[8](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Obstructed_labour).
        
- **Clinical Features:**
    
    - Prolonged, unprogressive labor often lasting more than 12 hours in the active phase
        
    - Severe abdominal and back pain, uterine hypertonicity or rigidity
        
    - Maternal exhaustion, dehydration, tachycardia
        
    - Possible vaginal bleeding, foul-smelling discharge if infection develops
        
    - Fetal distress or death due to hypoxia if unresolved
        
    - Signs of impending uterine rupture (e.g., pathological retraction ring) in severe cases[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9499287/)[4](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/7-2-obstructed-labour-51417478.html)[6](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/1obstructed-labor/142625982).
        
- **Complications:**
    
    - Maternal: Uterine rupture, hemorrhage, infections, sepsis, obstetric fistula (urethral/bladder/rectal fistula from tissue necrosis), death[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9499287/)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructed_labour)[4](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/7-2-obstructed-labour-51417478.html)[6](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/1obstructed-labor/142625982)[7](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/obstructed-labor/24693514).
        
    - Fetal: Hypoxia, stillbirth, neonatal asphyxia, death[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9499287/)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructed_labour)[6](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/1obstructed-labor/142625982)[8](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Obstructed_labour).
        
- **Diagnosis:**
    
    - Based on clinical criteria: labour not progressing despite adequate contractions
        
    - Use of partograph to monitor cervical dilation, fetal descent and contraction pattern
        
    - Physical examination revealing poor fetal descent, caput succedaneum without engagement, or fetal malposition[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructed_labour)[8](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Obstructed_labour)[10](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Labour_Dystocia).
        
- **Management:**
    
    - **Emergency cesarean section** is generally the definitive treatment to deliver the baby safely and prevent complications[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructed_labour)[7](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/obstructed-labor/24693514)[8](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Obstructed_labour).
        
    - Assisted delivery options (vacuum or forceps) may be attempted in specific cases with partial obstruction and favorable conditions.
        
    - Supportive care: hydration, correction of electrolyte imbalance, antibiotics if membranes ruptured >18 hours, monitoring maternal and fetal wellbeing[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructed_labour)[4](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/7-2-obstructed-labour-51417478.html)[7](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/obstructed-labor/24693514).
        
    - In rare cases, surgical measures like symphysiotomy (surgical widening of the pelvic bones) may be performed where cesarean is unavailable[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructed_labour).
        
    - Prevention relies on adequate prenatal care, nutrition, early identification of risk factors, and timely referral.
        
- **Epidemiology:**
    
    - Still a significant cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality in low-resource settings (especially Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia), accounting for a substantial percentage of maternal deaths and stillbirths[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9499287/)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstructed_labour)[6](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/1obstructed-labor/142625982).
        
    - Rare in well-resourced countries due to access to obstetric care and cesarean sections.

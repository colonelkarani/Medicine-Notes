## Fetal Station Numbering and the Ischial Spines

**Station** refers to the relationship of the presenting part of the fetus (usually the head) to the ischial spines of the maternal pelvis—a key concept in obstetrics for assessing fetal descent during labor.

## Station Nomenclature

- **Ischial spines** are used as the reference point (station 0).

- **Negative numbers** indicate the presenting part is _above_ the ischial spines (further into the maternal pelvis):
    
    - Station -5 to 0 (e.g., -3, -2, -1) as the fetus descends closer to the ischial spines.
        
- **Zero station (0)** means the leading part of the fetal head is _level_ with the ischial spines.
    
- **Positive numbers** indicate the presenting part is _below_ the ischial spines (closer to the vaginal opening and delivery):
    
    - Station +1 to +5 as the fetus descends further (e.g., +1, +2, +3).
        

## Quick Reference Table

|Station|Position Relative to Ischial Spines|
|---|---|
|-5 to -1|Above ischial spines|
|0|At ischial spines (engaged)|
|+1 to +5|Below ischial spines|

- **Key point:** Negative stations are above, positive stations are below the ischial spines.

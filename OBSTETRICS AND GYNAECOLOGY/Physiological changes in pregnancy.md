# Respiratory System
#### **INCREASES**

1. **Tidal Volume**
    
    - **Reason:** Progesterone stimulates the respiratory center in the brain, making you breathe deeper.
        
    - **Effect:** Each breath brings in more air (increased tidal volume), compensating for increased oxygen demand.
        
2. **Inspiratory Capacity**
    
    - **Reason:** With deeper breaths and enhanced chest expansion, the maximum amount of air inspired increases.
        
3. **Minute Ventilation**
    
    - **Reason:** This is the total air breathed in or out per minute (tidal volume × respiratory rate).
        
    - **Effect:** Increases mainly because of the increased tidal volume, not increased rate.
        

#### **DECREASES**

1. **FRC (Functional Residual Capacity)** 
	- *Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)* is the volume of air remaining in the lungs at the end of a _normal, passive exhalation_
    
2. **ERV (Expiratory Reserve Volume)**
    
3. **RV (Residual Volume)**
    
4. **TLC (Total Lung Capacity)**
    
    - **Reason for all above:** The enlarging uterus pushes the diaphragm upward, reducing space for lung expansion, especially the volumes left after normal expiration.
        
5. **PCO₂ (Partial Pressure of CO₂)**
    
    - **Reason:** Increased ventilation removes more CO₂ from the blood, helping create a mild respiratory alkalosis, which benefits fetal CO₂ transfer.
        

#### **UNAFFECTED**

1. **Respiratory Rate**
    
    - **Reason:** Although breathing is deeper, the **rate** itself doesn't increase significantly.
        
2. **Vital Capacity**
    
    - **Reason:** Vital capacity is the maximum air exhaled after a maximal inhalation. It remains essentially unchanged as reductions in some lung volumes are balanced by increases in others.
        
3. **Inspiratory Reserve Volume**
    
    - **Reason:** Despite uterine enlargement, breathing mechanics adjust so the largest extra breath (on top of tidal volume) stays similar.
        

#### **Summary Table**

|Change|Why it happens in pregnancy|
|---|---|
|**Tidal volume ↑**|Progesterone → deeper breathing|
|**Minute ventilation ↑**|Bigger breaths, not faster breathing|
|**Inspiratory capacity ↑**|More air inspired per breath|
|**FRC, ERV, RV, TLC ↓**|Diaphragm displaced by growing uterus → less room in chest|
|**PCO₂ ↓**|More CO₂ blown off due to increased ventilation|
|**No change (RR, VC, IRV)**|Rate remains same; vital capacity and inspiratory reserve maintained|

##### **Clinical Context**

These adaptations ensure that both mother and fetus get enough oxygen and efficiently remove carbon dioxide throughout pregnancy, even as the growing fetus and uterus change the mother's anatomy and physiology.

# Renal Changes in Pregnancy

## 1. Structural Changes

- **Kidney Size and Anatomy:**    
    - Kidney length and overall size **increase by 1–1.5 cm** during pregnancy.        
    - This is mainly due to **increased vascular and interstitial volume**.
        
- **Physiological Hydronephrosis and Hydroureter:**
    
    - Dilatation of the renal pelvis, calyces, and ureters occurs in up to **80% of pregnant women**, more often on the **right side**.
        
    - Caused by **hormonal smooth muscle relaxation** (progesterone, relaxin) and **mechanical compression by the gravid uterus**, especially the right ovarian and iliac veins pressing against the right ureter.
        
    - The renal pelvis diameter typically does not exceed 15 mm in the third trimester.
        
    - These changes may persist up to **6–12 weeks postpartum**.
        

## 2. Hemodynamic and Functional Changes

- **Increased Renal Blood Flow (RBF):**
    
    - RBF increases by approximately **50–80%** (some sources note up to 150%) during pregnancy.
        
- **Increased Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR):**
    
    - GFR rises by about **50%**, peaking in the second trimester and maintaining elevated levels throughout pregnancy.
        
    - This is mediated by **hormonal influences** such as **relaxin, progesterone, and nitric oxide** causing dilation of both afferent and efferent arterioles.
        
- **Serum Creatinine and Urea:**
    
    - Due to increased GFR, serum creatinine (sCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) **decline** during pregnancy compared to nonpregnant values.
        
    - Normal pregnancy serum creatinine reference ranges by trimester:
        
        - 1st trimester: ≤0.86 mg/dL (≤76 µmol/L)
            
        - 2nd trimester: ≤0.81 mg/dL (≤72 µmol/L) — nadir point
            
        - 3rd trimester: up to 0.87 mg/dL (77 µmol/L)
            
    - Values above these suggest renal impairment.
        
- **Creatinine Clearance:**
    
    - Increases accordingly with GFR, reflecting increased filtration capacity.
        

## 3. Tubular Function and Electrolyte Handling

- **Increased Sodium and Water Retention:**
    
    - Despite increased GFR (more filtered sodium), pregnant kidneys increase sodium reabsorption stimulated by the **activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)**.
        
    - This results in **net retention of ~1000 mg sodium daily**, contributing to plasma volume expansion of 30–50%.
        
- **Potassium Handling:**
    
    - Aldosterone levels rise but **progesterone antagonizes aldosterone’s effect on potassium**, protecting against hypokalemia.
        
- **Water Balance and Osmoregulation:**
    
    - The threshold for thirst and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) release is lowered.
        
    - Serum osmolality and sodium concentrations fall slightly (by about 5–10 mOsm/kg and 4–5 mmol/L, respectively). This mild physiologic hyponatremia aids plasma volume expansion.
        

## 4. Urinary Changes

- **Mild Proteinuria and Glucosuria:**
    
    - Mild protein excretion (up to 300 mg/24hr) and occasional glucosuria can occur due to increased GFR and tubular reabsorption alterations—both considered normal if minimal.
        
- **Increased Frequency of Urination:**
    
    - The growing uterus compresses the bladder and ureters, increasing urinary frequency, especially in the third trimester.
        
- **Risk of Urinary Stasis:**
    
    - Ureteral dilation and urinary stasis can predispose to urinary tract infections (UTIs).
        

## 5. Blood Pressure and Vascular Resistance

- Due to systemic vasodilation, **blood pressure drops by about 10 mmHg** in the second trimester, despite increased intravascular volume.
    
- This vasodilation results from vascular insensitivity to vasoconstrictors and increased production of vasodilators (e.g., nitric oxide).
    
- Activation of RAAS compensates to maintain volume and perfusion.
    

## Clinical Implications

| Change                                       | Clinical Significance                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Increased kidney size and hydronephrosis     | Can mimic obstructive uropathy; important to differentiate from pathology. Predisposes to urinary stasis and UTIs.(Most common UTI is E.Coli. Rx is NitroFuratoin (100mg BD 3 days)) |
| Increased GFR and decreased serum creatinine | Use pregnancy-specific reference ranges to correctly interpret renal function tests and avoid misdiagnosing preexisting renal impairment.                                            |
| Sodium and water retention                   | Contributes to physiologic edema; excessive retention may exacerbate hypertension or heart failure.                                                                                  |
| Mild proteinuria and glucosuria              | Usually benign but needs monitoring to rule out preeclampsia or gestational diabetes.                                                                                                |
| Increased urinary frequency and incontinence | Common symptoms; important to counsel and manage to reduce discomfort.                                                                                                               |
| Blood pressure changes                       | Hypotension and vasodilation are normal; failure to exhibit these changes may suggest hypertensive disorders.                                                                        |

## Summary Table of Selected Lab and Physiological Values by Trimester

|Parameter|1st Trimester|2nd Trimester (Nadir)|3rd Trimester|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Serum Creatinine (sCr)|≤0.86 mg/dL (76 µmol/L)|≤0.81 mg/dL (72 µmol/L)|≤0.87 mg/dL (77 µmol/L)|Above values indicate impaired renal function|
|GFR|↑ ~50% above baseline|Peak increase|Sustained elevated|Not routinely directly measured|
|Serum Sodium (Na⁺)|Slight decrease|Lowest (~4-5 mmol/L ↓)|Slight increase|Due to volume expansion and ADH changes|
|Plasma Volume|↑ (30-50%)|↑|↑|Supports fetal growth and maternal circulation|
|Urinary Albumin Excretion|Mildly increased|Mild proteinuria|Mild proteinuria|Up to 300 mg/day considered normal|

## Pathophysiological Explanations

- Hormones **progesterone, relaxin, and nitric oxide** play key roles in relaxing vascular smooth muscle and renal arterioles, increasing renal perfusion and filtration.
    
- The **RAAS** activation maintains sodium retention and increases blood volume despite systemic vasodilation.
    
- Anatomical distortion by the enlarging uterus compresses ureters, especially on the right side, causing urinary tract dilation and slowed urine flow.
    
- Reduced serum osmolality and lowered thresholds for ADH and thirst encourage plasma volume expansion necessary for fetal demand and placental perfusion.
    

This detailed overview covers the main physiological and anatomical renal changes in pregnancy, their lab correlates, pathophysiology, and clinical implications essential for understanding pregnancy kidney function.

# Cardiovascular Changes in Pregnancy

## 1. Hemodynamic Changes

|Parameter|Change|Timing|Magnitude|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Cardiac Output (CO)**|Increases by 30–50%|Begins early, peaks 16–28 weeks|Peaks ~45% by late 3rd trimester; +30–45% during labor contractions|
|**Heart Rate (HR)**|Increases 15–25%|Gradually throughout pregnancy|Peaks in 3rd trimester|
|**Stroke Volume (SV)**|Increases 20–30%|Throughout pregnancy|Steady progressive increase|
|**Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)**|Decreases up to 35–40%|Falls by mid-2nd trimester|Remains low with slight rise near term|
|**Blood Volume**|Increases by 30–50% (mainly plasma)|Peaks ~32–36 weeks|Plasma volume expansion > RBC mass (physiological anemia)|
|**Blood Pressure (BP)**|Decreases ~10–15 mmHg, especially diastolic|Lowest in mid-2nd trimester|Returns to pre-pregnancy levels postpartum|

## 3. Pathophysiology and Mechanisms

- **Vasodilation causes:**
    
    - Increased **estrogen and progesterone** → vascular smooth muscle relaxation.
        
    - Increased **nitric oxide (NO)** production → endothelial vasodilation.
        
    - Decreased sensitivity to vasoconstrictors (e.g., angiotensin II).
        
- **Volume expansion and RAAS activation:**
    
    - Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system stimulated → sodium and water retention.
        
    - Expansion of plasma volume and red cell mass.
        
    - Ensures adequate preload → maintains increased stroke volume.
        
- **Cardiac remodeling:**
    
    - Mild enlargement of all four chambers (eccentric hypertrophy) to accommodate increased volume load.
        
    - Left ventricular wall thickness slightly increased but preserved contractility.
        
- **Heart rate and contractility:**
    
    - HR increases progressively to maintain CO increases.
        
    - Contractility is generally maintained or slightly increased.
        

## 4. Detailed Trimester-Specific Changes

|Parameter|First Trimester|Second Trimester|Third Trimester|Labor/Postpartum|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cardiac Output|Rises ~20%|Rises rapidly to ~40% above baseline|Plateaus or peaks at ~45% increase|Increases 30–45% during contractions, then returns to baseline by 6 weeks postpartum|
|Heart Rate|Rises 15%|Rises further (~18%)|Peaks (~25% over baseline)|Peaks up to 40–50% increase during labor contractions|
|Stroke Volume|Increases by about 20%|Increases steadily|Maintained or slightly increased|Increases during labor|
|Blood Volume|Increases ~5%|Rises to ~15%|Peaks around 20–50% over baseline|Returns to normal over 2–6 weeks postpartum|
|Systemic Vascular Resistance|Falls early (~35–40%)|Lowest point|Slight increase approaching term|Returns to normal soon after delivery|
|Blood Pressure|Slight decrease|Decreases to nadir (~10–15 mmHg fall)|Slight rise toward baseline|Returns to baseline levels by 2 weeks postpartum|

## 5. Clinical Implications and Signs

|Change|Clinical Significance|
|---|---|
|Increased CO and blood volume|Supports uteroplacental perfusion, but increases cardiac workload; unmasking preexisting heart disease possible.|
|Decline in SVR and BP|May cause orthostatic hypotension and sensation of dizziness; important to differentiate from pathological hypotension.|
|Elevated HR and SV|Can cause palpitations, mild tachycardia considered normal.|
|Chamber enlargement and murmurs|Systolic ejection murmurs are common (up to 90%), third heart sounds in 80%; pathologic murmurs warrant further evaluation.|
|Increased venous return and uterine compression|Supine hypotension syndrome due to inferior vena cava compression leading to decreased venous return and presyncope.|
|Increased risk of thromboembolism|Hypercoagulable state develops; increased vigilance required during pregnancy and postpartum.|

## 6. Typical Auscultatory & ECG Changes

- **Heart sounds:**
    
    - Increased intensity and splitting of the first heart sound.
        
    - Presence of an **ejection systolic murmur** heard over aortic and pulmonary valves (physiological).
        
    - Possible third heart sound due to increased flow.
        
- **ECG:**
    
    - Minor left or right axis deviations.
        
    - Increased heart rate observed.
        
    - No significant interval changes normally.
        

## 7. Summary Table of Normal Pregnancy Cardiovascular Changes

|Parameter|Change (% or value)|Timing|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cardiac Output (CO)|+30–50%|Starts early, peaks 2nd trimester|Increases further during labor|
|Heart Rate (HR)|+15–25%|Progresses through pregnancy|Peaks during labor contractions|
|Stroke Volume (SV)|+20–30%|Throughout pregnancy|Sustained increase|
|Blood Volume|+30–50% (mainly plasma)|Peaks ~32–36 weeks|Physiological anemia due to plasma > RBC increase|
|Systemic Vascular Resistance|-35–40%|Lowest mid-2nd trimester|Slight rise near term, returns postpartum|
|Blood Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic)|↓10–15 mmHg (mostly diastolic)|Nadir mid-2nd trimester|Returns to baseline postpartum|

## 8. Pathological Considerations

- **Maladaptation to these changes can lead to:**
    
    - **Preeclampsia/eclampsia:** due to failure of normal vasodilation and placental vascular remodeling.
        
    - **Peripartum cardiomyopathy:** heart failure related to inability to meet increased cardiac demands.
        
    - **Exacerbation of underlying cardiac disease:** congenital or acquired heart conditions can worsen or become symptomatic.
        
- **Pregnancy as a "stress test":**
    
    - Reveals previously silent cardiovascular diseases.
        
    - Requires careful preconception and antenatal cardiac evaluation in high-risk patients.
        

## 9. Postpartum Changes

- Most cardiovascular parameters return to pre-pregnancy values within **2 weeks to 6 weeks postpartum**.
    
- Cardiac output decreases rapidly after delivery due to loss of placental circulation and uterine autotransfusion.
    
- Blood volume and heart rate normalize gradually.
    


### **Summary:**  
Pregnancy is associated with increased cardiac output due to rises in stroke volume and heart rate, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and expanded blood volume, all orchestrated to meet the needs of mother and fetus. Adaptations begin early, peak mid-pregnancy, and normalize postpartum. These changes may unmask or worsen preexisting cardiovascular conditions, making monitoring critical in pregnancy care.

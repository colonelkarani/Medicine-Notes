### Respiratory System
#### **INCREASES**

1. **Tidal Volume**
    
    - **Reason:** Progesterone stimulates the respiratory center in the brain, making you breathe deeper.
        
    - **Effect:** Each breath brings in more air (increased tidal volume), compensating for increased oxygen demand.
        
2. **Inspiratory Capacity**
    
    - **Reason:** With deeper breaths and enhanced chest expansion, the maximum amount of air inspired increases.
        
3. **Minute Ventilation**
    
    - **Reason:** This is the total air breathed in or out per minute (tidal volume × respiratory rate).
        
    - **Effect:** Increases mainly because of the increased tidal volume, not increased rate.
        

#### **DECREASES**

1. **FRC (Functional Residual Capacity)** 
	- *Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)* is the volume of air remaining in the lungs at the end of a _normal, passive exhalation_
    
2. **ERV (Expiratory Reserve Volume)**
    
3. **RV (Residual Volume)**
    
4. **TLC (Total Lung Capacity)**
    
    - **Reason for all above:** The enlarging uterus pushes the diaphragm upward, reducing space for lung expansion, especially the volumes left after normal expiration.
        
5. **PCO₂ (Partial Pressure of CO₂)**
    
    - **Reason:** Increased ventilation removes more CO₂ from the blood, helping create a mild respiratory alkalosis, which benefits fetal CO₂ transfer.
        

#### **UNAFFECTED**

1. **Respiratory Rate**
    
    - **Reason:** Although breathing is deeper, the **rate** itself doesn't increase significantly.
        
2. **Vital Capacity**
    
    - **Reason:** Vital capacity is the maximum air exhaled after a maximal inhalation. It remains essentially unchanged as reductions in some lung volumes are balanced by increases in others.
        
3. **Inspiratory Reserve Volume**
    
    - **Reason:** Despite uterine enlargement, breathing mechanics adjust so the largest extra breath (on top of tidal volume) stays similar.
        

#### **Summary Table**

|Change|Why it happens in pregnancy|
|---|---|
|**Tidal volume ↑**|Progesterone → deeper breathing|
|**Minute ventilation ↑**|Bigger breaths, not faster breathing|
|**Inspiratory capacity ↑**|More air inspired per breath|
|**FRC, ERV, RV, TLC ↓**|Diaphragm displaced by growing uterus → less room in chest|
|**PCO₂ ↓**|More CO₂ blown off due to increased ventilation|
|**No change (RR, VC, IRV)**|Rate remains same; vital capacity and inspiratory reserve maintained|

## **Clinical Context**

These adaptations ensure that both mother and fetus get enough oxygen and efficiently remove carbon dioxide throughout pregnancy, even as the growing fetus and uterus change the mother's anatomy and physiology.

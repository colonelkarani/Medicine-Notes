#### Hemolytic disease of newborn 

Condition whereby **lifespan of the infants red cells is shortened by maternal antibodies** 

###### Classifications 
- ABO
- Rhesus accompanied by other anti D
- Other unexpected antibodies
	- Anti- K **second most common** 
		- Caused by multiple tranfusions


**Presenting syndrome**
- Jaundice
- Anaemia
- Fetal hydrops
- Erythroblasts

###### Differential diagnosis
- RBC enzyme disorders
	- G6PD
	- pyruvate kinase
	- alpha thalasemia
- RBC membrane abnormalities
	- Spherocytosis
	- Elliptocytosis
- Acquired
	- Sepsis
	- TORCH, ParvoB19
	- Drugs

### ABO Hemolytic Disease

##### Pathophysiology

- Mother is O + and baby is A,AB, B
	- Agglutination of the cells
- Newborn blood destruction within 24hrs
- Babies with A commonly affected
- 50% in first born

##### Pathogenesis

- Occur 24 hrs after childbirth because in utero the IgM antibodies were not able to cross the placenta
- Causes jaundice, kernicterus, fetal irritability, hepatospenomegaly, anaemia, erythroblastosis, reticuloblastosis
- Most cases are self limiting

##### Management

- Reassure the mother
- Phototherapy
- Exchange transfusion


### Rhesus Hemolytic Disease
Many antigens expressed on the rhesus factor
Caused by 
- Anti D **most common**
- Anti c **third most common**

###### Epidemiology
Common in Spain **30%**, Caucasians **20%** then Africans **5%**

###### Pathogenesis
Maternal IgG Anti D antibodies cross the placenta and attack the fetus RBCs
This causes 
- hemolysis and degradation of the rbcs causing a rise in bilirubin, 
- hepatosplenomegaly due to portal hypertension, 
- Increased placental thickness due to fetal hypoxia
- Anasarca due to portal hypertension and reduced albumin from liver damage

**Maternal cells can cross the placenta** and causes increased lysis of the fetal cells ---> Detected by Direct Coombs Test

###### Risk Factors
- Maternal transfusion with Rh + blood
- Severe Antepartum Hemorrhage
- Fetal Maternal Transfusion


#### Investigations
- Paternal Blood Group
- Amniotic Fluid Spectrophotomery(bilirubin levels)
- Blood Smears
- Direct Coombs test


Hyperbilirubinemia
Anemia
Reticulocytosis (6 to 40%)
increased nucleated RBC count (>IO/IOO WBCs)
Thrombocytopenia
Leucopenia
Direct Antiglobulin Test! 
Hypoalbuminemia
Smear: polychromasia, anisocytosis, no spherocyte
Rh negative blood type



##### Management ??
- Give 300mg AntiD   *delivery 500mg*  within 72hrs and at 28 wks
- Phototherapy
- Fetal Transfusion, ultrasound directed
- Steroids
- Plasmapheresis

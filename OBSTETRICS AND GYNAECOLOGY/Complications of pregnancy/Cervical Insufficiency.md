**Cervical insufficiency** (also called incompetent cervix) is a condition in pregnancy where the cervix **painlessly softens, shortens, and dilates prematurely**, usually during the **second trimester**, leading to increased risk of miscarriage or preterm birth without contractions or labor[1](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency).

## Key Features

- **Definition:** Painless cervical dilation during the second trimester without contractions, causing fetal loss or preterm delivery[1](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency).
    
- **Incidence:** About 1 in 100 to 1 in 2000 pregnancies are affected[1](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)[7](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/complications-of-pregnancy/cervical-insufficiency).
    
- **Common timing:** Typically manifests between **14 and 27 weeks** gestation (second trimester)[2](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17912-incompetent-cervix)[6](https://www.webmd.com/women/what-is-incompetent-cervix)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency).
    

## Causes and Risk Factors

Cervical insufficiency is thought to result from a combination of **structural weakness** and/or **biochemical factors** affecting the cervix:

- Congenital connective tissue disorders (e.g., Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)[7](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/complications-of-pregnancy/cervical-insufficiency)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)
    
- Prior cervical trauma or surgeries:
    
    - Cone biopsy or cervical conization (particularly if a large portion was removed)[7](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/complications-of-pregnancy/cervical-insufficiency)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)
        
    - Deep cervical lacerations during childbirth[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)
        
- Müllerian duct anomalies (e.g., bicornuate or septate uterus)[7](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/complications-of-pregnancy/cervical-insufficiency)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)
    
- Previous second-trimester pregnancy losses (≥2 miscarriages increase risk)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)
    
- Multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets) and Black race have higher incidence[2](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17912-incompetent-cervix)
    
- Prior excessive or rapid cervical dilation with instruments (less common now)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)
    

Many women have no identified risk factors, indicating other unknown causes.

## Symptoms

- Often **asymptomatic** until advanced cervical changes or preterm delivery[1](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)[7](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/complications-of-pregnancy/cervical-insufficiency).
    
- Possible early signs include:
    
    - Pelvic or vaginal **pressure** or fullness
        
    - Mild **vaginal bleeding or spotting**
        
    - Lower abdominal or **back pain or cramps**
        
    - Increased vaginal **discharge**
        
- Unlike preterm labor, **no regular contractions** or labor pains occur[1](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)[7](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/complications-of-pregnancy/cervical-insufficiency).
    

## Diagnosis

- Usually suspected after **previous second-trimester losses** or in patients with risk factors[1](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency).
    
- **Pelvic examination** may reveal a soft, shortened, or dilated cervix without contractions.
    
- **Transvaginal ultrasound** between about 15 and 24 weeks to measure cervical length is key:
    
    - Cervical length ≤ 2.5 cm (short cervix) suggests increased risk[1](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)
        
    - Visualization of **cervical dilation** or protruding fetal membranes into the cervical canal strongly suggests insufficiency[1](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency).
        
- Serial ultrasounds may be done to monitor cervical changes in at-risk women[1](https://www.msdmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency).
    

## Treatment

## 1. **Cervical Cerclage** (surgical stitching of the cervix)

- The primary treatment to prevent premature dilation and delivery.
    
- Usually placed in the **early second trimester** (12 to 16 weeks), especially if a history of cervical insufficiency exists.
    
- Procedure involves placing sutures around the cervix through the vagina to keep it closed.
    
- Sutures generally removed around 36 weeks or when labor begins[5](https://www.upmc.com/services/womens-health/conditions/cervical-insufficiency)[7](https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/women-s-health-issues/complications-of-pregnancy/cervical-insufficiency)[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency).
    
- Not recommended if:
    
    - The patient is carrying multiples
        
    - The membranes have already ruptured (water break)[5](https://www.upmc.com/services/womens-health/conditions/cervical-insufficiency).
        

## 2. **Progesterone supplementation**

- Progesterone may be prescribed in women with a history of preterm birth or a short cervix without prior preterm birth.
    
- Given as:
    
    - Weekly intramuscular injections or
        
    - Vaginal suppositories
        
- Progesterone helps reduce risk of early preterm labor by maintaining uterine quiescence and cervical integrity[5](https://www.upmc.com/services/womens-health/conditions/cervical-insufficiency).
    

## 3. **Close monitoring**

- Serial cervical length measurement by transvaginal ultrasound.
    
- Bed rest or physical activity restriction is sometimes recommended but evidence is limited.
    

## Prognosis and Recurrence

- Women with cervical insufficiency are at increased risk of **preterm birth in future pregnancies**—approximately a 30% risk of recurrence after two or more losses[8](https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/antenatal-complications/cervical-insufficiency).
    
- With proper cerclage and/or progesterone therapy, many can carry pregnancies to viability or term.

**Placental abruption** (also called abruptio placentae) is a serious obstetric emergency characterized by **premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall after 20 weeks of gestation**, most commonly in the third trimester. This detachment disrupts the oxygen and nutrient supply to the fetus and causes maternal bleeding, which may be visible or concealed.

## Pathophysiology

- The placenta normally attaches firmly to the uterine lining, providing oxygen and nutrients to the fetus.
    
- In placental abruption, a section or all of the placenta separates before delivery, often due to blood accumulating between the placenta and uterus.
    
- This separation reduces fetal oxygenation and may lead to fetal distress, growth restriction, or death.
    
- Maternal hemorrhage can be severe, potentially causing hypovolemic shock, coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation—DIC), and organ failure.
    

## Epidemiology and Risk Factors

- Occurs in about 1% of pregnancies; serious cause of maternal morbidity and perinatal mortality.
    
- Risk factors include:
    
    - **Hypertensive disorders** of pregnancy (preeclampsia, chronic hypertension)
        
    - Previous placental abruption
        
    - Abdominal trauma (car accidents, falls, physical abuse)
        
    - Smoking and cocaine use
        
    - Advanced maternal age (>35 years)
        
    - Multiparity and multiple gestations
        
    - Uterine abnormalities or scarring (e.g., previous cesareans)
        
    - Thrombophilia or clotting disorders
        
    - Infection of the uterus
        

## Clinical Presentation

- **Vaginal bleeding**: May be visible or concealed if blood collects behind placenta.
    
- **Abdominal pain** and uterine tenderness or rigidity.
    
- **Sudden onset** of continuous, severe uterine contractions or tetanic uterine tone.
    
- **Back pain**, often severe.
    
- Symptoms may develop suddenly or insidiously if abruption is chronic.
    
- Signs of **fetal distress**: abnormal fetal heart rate, decreased movements.
    
- In severe cases, signs of maternal shock: low blood pressure, rapid pulse, pallor.
    

## Diagnosis

- Primarily clinical suspicion based on symptoms and signs.
    
- **Ultrasound** may show retroplacental hematoma but can be normal, so a negative scan does not exclude abruption.
    
- Continuous **fetal heart rate monitoring** for fetal well-being.
    
- Maternal labs to check hemoglobin, coagulation profile (DIC), and blood typing for possible transfusion.
    

## Severity Classification (Grades)

- **Grade 1 (Mild):** Minimal bleeding, mild uterine tenderness, no fetal distress.
    
- **Grade 2 (Moderate):** Moderate bleeding, uterine tenderness, signs of fetal distress.
    
- **Grade 3 (Severe):** Severe bleeding, uterine tetany, maternal shock, fetal death.
    

## Management

Treatment depends on **severity, gestational age, and maternal/fetal stability**:

|Condition|Management|
|---|---|
|Mild/moderate abruption <37 weeks|Hospitalization, close monitoring of mother and fetus; bed rest|
||Corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity (<34 weeks)|
|Severe abruption or maternal instability|Immediate delivery (usually cesarean) to save mother and fetus|
|Stable mother, reassuring fetus, near term|Consider induction of labor for vaginal delivery if no contraindications|
|Bleeding control|IV fluids, blood transfusion, correction of coagulopathy|

- Prepare for postpartum hemorrhage, which is common.
    
- **Vaginal delivery** may be attempted if mother is stable, fetus is stable, and no contraindications.
    
- Continued close monitoring with readiness for emergency cesarean if deterioration occurs.
    

## Complications

- Fetal hypoxia, preterm birth, stillbirth
    
- Maternal hemorrhagic shock, DIC, renal failure, need for hysterectomy
    
- Increased risk of abruption recurrence in future pregnancies
    

## Summary Table

|Aspect|Details|
|---|---|
|Definition|Premature separation of placenta from uterus after 20 weeks|
|Most common timing|Third trimester, often last weeks of pregnancy|
|Symptoms|Vaginal bleeding (may be concealed), abdominal/back pain, uterine tenderness, contractions|
|Diagnosis|Clinical; ultrasound may help but not definitive|
|Risk factors|Hypertension, trauma, prior abruption, smoking, cocaine, advanced maternal age|
|Management|Depends on severity; hospitalization, monitoring, corticosteroids if preterm, delivery if unstable|
|Delivery considerations|Cesarean for severe cases; vaginal delivery if mother/fetus stable|
|Maternal/fetal risks|Severe hemorrhage, shock, coagulopathy, fetal hypoxia, death|

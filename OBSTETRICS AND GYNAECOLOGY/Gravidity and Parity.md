## Easy Ways to Remember Gravidity and Parity

Understanding and recalling gravidity and parity can be confusing, but a few simple tricks can help:

## Gravidity (G)

- **What it means:** The **number of times a woman has ever been pregnant**, regardless of outcome (includes the current pregnancy and all losses or terminations).
    
- **Mnemonic:**  _G_ravidity = _G_ot pregnant (each time).
    
- **Tip:** Even if someone is pregnant with twins, it still counts as ONE gravidity because it’s one pregnancy episode[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravidity_and_parity)[2](https://patient.info/doctor/gravidity-and-parity-definitions-and-their-implications-in-risk-assessment).
    

## Parity (P)

- **What it means:** The **number of pregnancies carried to a viable gestational age** (typically 20 or 24 weeks, depending on the guideline), regardless of whether the resulting infants were born alive or stillborn.
    
- **Mnemonic:** _P_arity = _P_ast point of viability (pregnancies reaching the threshold for birth).
    
- **Tip:** Parity counts pregnancies, not babies. Twin or triplet births still count as ONE parity[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravidity_and_parity)[3](https://nurseslabs.com/gtpal-guide-to-gravidity-and-parity-in-obstetrics/).
    

## Simple Table to Help Recall

|Term|What to Remember|Quick Cue|
|---|---|---|
|Gravidity|# of pregnancies|"G = Got Pregnant"|
|Parity|# reaching viability|"P = Past Viable"|

## GTPAL System (For Full Obstetric History)

You might also see the **GTPAL** system:

- **G**ravida: total pregnancies
    
- **T**erm: births at term (≥37 weeks)
    
- **P**reterm: births 20–36 weeks
    
- **A**bortion: losses before viability (<20 weeks)
    
- **L**iving: number of living children[3](https://nurseslabs.com/gtpal-guide-to-gravidity-and-parity-in-obstetrics/)
    

Writing down "GTPAL" on paper with quick reminders next to each letter can help during exams or charts (e.g., 
"G = pregnant," "T = 37+ weeks," "L = living children")[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravidity_and_parity)[3](https://nurseslabs.com/gtpal-guide-to-gravidity-and-parity-in-obstetrics/).

## Additional Memory Tricks

- **Simple phrase:** “Gravida = gotten pregnant; Para = past the point (of viability).”
    
- **Visualize:** Imagine a woman with 3 pregnancies:
    
    - One miscarriage at 8 weeks (G1, not P),
        
    - One set of twins born at 38 weeks (G2, P1),
        
    - Currently pregnant (G3, P1).  
        → She’s G3 P1.
        

Sticking to the “G = every pregnancy, P = reached viable age” rule and using these mnemonics will help you confidently recall gravidity and parity when you need them[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravidity_and_parity)[2](https://patient.info/doctor/gravidity-and-parity-definitions-and-their-implications-in-risk-assessment)[3](https://nurseslabs.com/gtpal-guide-to-gravidity-and-parity-in-obstetrics/).

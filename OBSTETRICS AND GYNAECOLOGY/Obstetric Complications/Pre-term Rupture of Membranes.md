**PROM** - Rupture of membranes before the onset of contractions after 37 weeks of gestation.
PPROM - Rupture of membranes before 37 weeks gestation

#### Classifications of deliveries
• Early term: 37 0/7 weeks through 38 6/7 weeks
• Full term: 39 0/7 weeks through 40 6/7 weeks
• Late term: 41 0/7 weeks through 41 6/7 weeks
• Postterm: 42 0/7 weeks and beyond


#### Risk Factors
- Maternal Infections
- Cervical Insufficiency
- Overdistention of the uterus
- Genetic History
- Membranes abnormality
- Iatrogenic
- Malnutrition

### Clinical Presentation

- Sudden gush of amniotic fluid or leakage
- Staining
- Reduction of the uterine size
- Prolapse of fetal part

### Diagnosis
 - History and Examination
 - Speculum exam 
 - FBC, UEC
 - Fibronectin test
	 - Measures the presence of fetal fibronectin protein in vaginal or cervical secretions
 - Ferning test
	 - Detect the presence of amniotic fluid
 - Nitrazine test
	 - Measuring the pH of vaginal fluid using paper strips impregnated with nitrazine dye
 - Imaging
	 - US

### Management

#### Conservative
- Tocolytics
- Corticosteroids (dexamethasone, betamethasone)
- Prophylactic antibiotics (Conchrane)
- Increase the Amniotic Fluid Volume by :
	- Transvaginal, transabdominal amnioinfusion
	- Amniopatch
	- Bioadhesive glue
#### Active
##### 24 - 30 wks
Need for lung maturity and surfactants at birth to prevent Respiratory Distress Syndrome
##### 30 - 36 wks
Same as above but with better outcomes
##### >36 wks
Advised to deliver

#### Delivery
Vaginal delivery preferred unless contraindicated

#### Complications
- Increased CS
- Fetal Hypoxia
- Cord Prolapse, Compression
- Oligohydramnios Tetrad ( **Potters Sequence** )
	- Facial Abnormalities
	- Limb deformities
	- Pulmonary hypoplasia
	- Impaired fetal growth

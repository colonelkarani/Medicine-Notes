Genital tract fistulas are abnormal openings or connections that develop between the female genital tract (vagina or uterus) and nearby organs such as the urinary tract or the gastrointestinal tract. These fistulas cause an unwanted passage for fluids like urine or feces to leak into the vagina, leading to significant clinical and social problems. They are classified based on the organs involved in the abnormal communication.

## Types of Genital Tract Fistulas

Genital tract fistulas vary depending on their anatomical location and which organs are linked:

- **Vesicovaginal fistula:** Opening between the vagina and the urinary bladder. This is the most common type and causes urine leakage into the vagina.
    
- **Ureterovaginal fistula:** Connection between the vagina and the ureters (tubes carrying urine from kidneys to bladder), causing urine bypass from ureters into the vagina.
    
- **Urethrovaginal fistula:** Opening between the vagina and urethra (urine channel from bladder to outside).
    
- **Rectovaginal fistula:** Opening between the vagina and rectum (part of large intestine), resulting in fecal leakage.
    
- **Colovaginal fistula:** Connection between the vagina and colon (large intestine).
    
- **Enterovaginal fistula:** Opening between vagina and small intestine.
    

These abnormal passages result in incontinence of urine or feces, leading to tissue irritation, infection, and social stigma[1](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vaginal-fistula)[2](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-fistulas/symptoms-causes/syc-20355762)[3](https://www.webmd.com/women/what-is-a-vaginal-fistula)[4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22079-vaginal-fistula)[5](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vaginal-fistula)[6](https://www.nyp.org/womens/urogynecology/vaginal-fistula)[8](https://www.glowm.com/article/heading/vol-7--fistula--female-genital-fistula/id/418273).

## Causes and Risk Factors

Genital fistulas typically result from:

- **Obstetric trauma:** Prolonged or obstructed labor causing pressure necrosis of the vaginal and adjacent tissues.
    
- **Surgery:** Pelvic, abdominal, or gynecologic surgeries like hysterectomy can accidentally create fistulas. cs,hysterectomy,colporrhaphy,D&C,
    
- **Radiation therapy:** Pelvic radiation for cancers can damage tissues and cause fistulas.
    
- **Cancer:** Pelvic tumors invading adjacent organs.
    
- **Infection and inflammation:** Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis), infections, or trauma can contribute.
    
- **Trauma:** Pelvic injuries, foreign bodies, or severe tissue damage[1](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vaginal-fistula)[2](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-fistulas/symptoms-causes/syc-20355762)[3](https://www.webmd.com/women/what-is-a-vaginal-fistula)[4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22079-vaginal-fistula)[5](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vaginal-fistula)[9](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Obstetric_Fistula)[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333495/).
- Sexual Assault
    

## Pathophysiology
- Obstetric fistula is caused by prolonged obstructed labor
- Common site for ischaemic injury is urethro-vesical junction
 ![Development-of-the-urinary-system.webp (850×562)](https://www.online-sciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Development-of-the-urinary-system.webp)
- Tissue damage, ischemia, and necrosis lead to the formation of a fistulous tract.
- The tissue separating the organs dies or becomes severely damaged, allowing an abnormal communication to form.
- The fistula may develop rapidly after injury or persist over a long time[4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22079-vaginal-fistula)[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333495/).

## Symptoms

Symptoms depend on the fistula type but commonly include:

- Continuous leaking of urine, feces, or gas into the vagina.
    
- Foul-smelling vaginal discharge.
    
- Vaginal infections and tissue irritation or sores.
    
- Urinary tract infections and possible kidney infections.
    
- Abdominal pain, bleeding, or other irritative symptoms.
    
- Social and psychological distress due to incontinence and odor[1](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vaginal-fistula)[2](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-fistulas/symptoms-causes/syc-20355762)[3](https://www.webmd.com/women/what-is-a-vaginal-fistula)[5](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vaginal-fistula)[6](https://www.nyp.org/womens/urogynecology/vaginal-fistula).
    
## Signs

- CS scar
- Abdominal masses
- Wetness
- Urine dermatitis
- Vaginal length, scarring, defect
- SIMS speculum --> Urine in vagina or stool
- 
## Diagnosis

Diagnosis primarily involves a detailed history and physical/pelvic examination. 


Additional tests may include:

- Dye tests (inserting dye into bladder or rectum to detect leakage).*Dye test negative and urine present think ureteric fistula*
    
- Imaging: Ultrasound, CT scan, MRI to locate the fistula.
- 
    
- Endoscopic methods: Cystourethroscopy (bladder and urethra), colonoscopy (bowel).  
    These help pinpoint the fistula location and assess any tissue damage for treatment planning[1](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vaginal-fistula)[2](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-fistulas/symptoms-causes/syc-20355762)[4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22079-vaginal-fistula).
## Investigations

- HIV RBC, FBC, U/C, 
- KUB U/S - hydronephrosis, bladder stones
- HSG for vesicouterine
- CT pyelogram

## Treatment

Treatment depends on size, location, and cause of the fistula:

- Small fistulas may occasionally heal with catheter drainage. (Indwelling foley)
- Debridement    
- Most require surgical repair, which can be approached vaginally or abdominally.
    
- Surgery aims to close the fistulous opening and restore normal organ function.
    
- Postoperative care often includes physical therapy to improve pelvic floor strength.
    
- Management of infections and underlying causes are important adjuncts[1](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vaginal-fistula)[2](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-fistulas/symptoms-causes/syc-20355762)[3](https://www.webmd.com/women/what-is-a-vaginal-fistula)[4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22079-vaginal-fistula)[5](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vaginal-fistula).
### Principles of VVF surgery

• Adequate exposure
• Protection of ureters
• Separation of vagina from the bladder around the fistula
• Adequate mobilization of bladder
• Water tight closure
• Approach-usually vaginal.some cases abdominally
    
Post-operative care
• Continuous bladder drainage for 5-14 days
• Drink water/fluids 3 Its in 24 hrs
• Perineal/vaginal cleaning twice daily
• Sexual Abstainance for 3 months
• Delivery-elective cs
## Social and Health Impact

Genital tract fistulas primarily affect women in resource-limited settings due to limited obstetric care. They cause significant morbidity, including chronic infections, infertility, social isolation, and psychological trauma[5](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vaginal-fistula).

In summary, genital tract fistulas are abnormal passageways connecting the vagina with urinary or intestinal organs, resulting from obstetric injury, surgery, cancer, radiation, or infection. They cause urinary or fecal incontinence, infection, and severe quality of life impairment. 

Backlog of cases

Diagnosis is clinical supported by imaging, and treatment is largely surgical to repair the defect and restore continence[1](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vaginal-fistula)[2](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vaginal-fistulas/symptoms-causes/syc-20355762)[3](https://www.webmd.com/women/what-is-a-vaginal-fistula)[4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22079-vaginal-fistula)[5](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vaginal-fistula)[6](https://www.nyp.org/womens/urogynecology/vaginal-fistula)[8](https://www.glowm.com/article/heading/vol-7--fistula--female-genital-fistula/id/418273)[9](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Obstetric_Fistula)[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333495/).

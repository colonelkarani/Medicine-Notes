Venous Thromboembolism in pregnancy
- DVT - 80%
- PE - 20%

Risk is greater in postpartum vs antepartum and higher risk of left sided DVT

Virchow's triad - 
- Stasis
	- progesterone effect - vasodilation
	- Compression of ivc and iliac vein(right iliac artery) by gravid uterus
		-![[Pasted image 20250731140140.png]]
	- Reduced activity in pregnancy
- Hypercoagulable state
	- Increased procoagulant
	- !![[Pasted image 20250731140240.png]]
	- Increased fibrinolytic inhibitors PAI 1 & 2
- Endothelial damage
	- Increased in operative delivery and abdominal delivery
### Risk Factors
#### Antepartum
- Multiple births
- Varicose veins
- Inflammatory bowel disease
- Urinary tract infection
- Diabetes
- Hospitalization for non-delivery reasons
(>3 days)
- Body mass index (BMI) >30 kg/m2
- Increased maternal age >35 years
- Hypertension
- Smoking
- Eclampsia or preeclampsia
#### Postpartum
- Cesarean delivery
- Still birth
- Young gestational age


## Presentation
- Proximal vein thrombosis
	- diffuse pain and swelling
	- Erythema
- Iliac vein thrombosis
	- Swelling of entire leg
	- can affect flank, lower abdomen, buttock
- Low grade fever


### Diagnosis
Proximal vein CUS  (Compressive Ultrasound)- femoral popliteal
Serial CUS - repeatedly
### DDx
CVE 
Tumors
Cellulitis
Lymphedema
Edema
Ruptured Bakers Cyst
# Pulmonary Embolism

Clinical features:
- Dyspnea
- Acute chest pain
- Crepitation
- Tachychardia
- Tachypnea
#### Diagnosis
Use :
	clinical decision
	Baseline investigations - FBC, UECS, LFT, COAG
	d-dimer assays
	CTPA- gold standard

#### Management
Intravenous Heparin Unfractionated **LMWH**
- Not cross placenta,
- Lower risk hepatin induced thrombocytopaenia
- reduced osteoporosis risk
Thrombolytic thereapy
IVC tents
Thoracotomy, embolectomy

 ### Thromboprophylaxis?
 - Previous VTE
 - Previous admission while pregnant
 - Known thrombophilias

Mechanical and pharmacological:
- Mechanical 
	- Early mobilization
	- Exercises
	- Compression stockings
- Phamacological
	- Enoxaparin
	- High risk?
		- aspirin, lmwh(can cause osteoporosis)


### Risk factors for dvt

P- prevoius dvt
R- restriction
E - elevated age , bmi,
G - gravidity multiple
N - Nursing home, pelvic veins
A- Antiphospholipid/thrombophilia
N- New illnesses
T- Trauma

V- vigilant booking,Risk assessment
E- early mobilization,stocking
A- anticoagulation with lmwh
L- lab monitoring
C- coordination of lmwh and delivery
H- heparin restart post partum 24hrs
O- Observe for bleeding
P- prolong anticoagulation postpartum

DM-> chronic metabolic condition characterised by absolute or relative insulin deficiency resulting in increased glucose concentration
### Ada classification
- Type 1 
	- Insulin deficiency
- Type 2
	- defective insulin secretion
	- insulin resistance
	- Increased glucose
- Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
	- DM diagnosed in pregnancy

### Whites classification

### Pathophysiology
Pregnancy is a diabetogenic effect because of 
- Increased postprandial glucose
- Increased insulin response (late gestation)

##### Early gestation (Anabolic state)
- Increase in maternal fat stores
- Decrease FFA concentration
- Blood glucose is lower
- Decreased insulin requirements
	- Fetus consumes glucose
	- Hyperemesis 
	- Increased insulin sensitivity, clearance , secretion

##### Late gestation
- **Glucose metabolism**
	- Decrease peripheral insulin sensitivity
		- increased production of pregnancy hormones
		- mediators of insulin resistance
	- Increase in maternal fasting glucose
	- Lipid Metabolism

- **Lipid metabolism**
	- Excessive fetal growth
	- Increased TGs, Cholesterol

- **Amino Acids**
	- Increased protein synthesis

### Risk factors
- Previous GDM
- BMI >30kg/m^2
- Age >35yrs
- Prediabetic
- Race - africans and hispanics
- Fundal height > gestational age
- Family history
- Corticosteroids
- HTN
- Recurrent candidiasis


### Screening
- Universal screening at **24-28 weeks**
	- Screen earlier if she has risk factors

### Diagnosis

| measure                | threshold            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Fasting plasma glucose | >7.0mmol(126mg/dl)   |
| HBAIC                  | >6.5%                |
| Random plasma glucose  | >11.1mmol/l(200mgdl) |
**OGTT**
- Patient fasts 8hrs before OGTT
- Start with 50gms then 75gms
	- FPG >5.3mmol
	- 1hr >10.6mmol
	- 2hr>9mmol

### Effect of GDM in pregnancy
##### Mother

- Pre-eclampsia
- PPH due to large baby (urinary distension)
- Increased risk of infections
	- chorioamnionitis
	- endometritis
	- Candidiasis
	- Wound infection
	- UTI
- Cesaarean section and vaginal operative deliveries
- Long term risk of DM
- Increased morbidity and mortality

#### Fetus

- Stillbirth 
	- Chronic intrauterine hypoxia
		- altered oxygen release , altered blood flow
		- Increased insulin, increased metabolic rate
- Congenital malformations **Due to Hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia**
	- Cardiac 
		- TOGV
		- VSD
		- ASD
	- CNS
		- NTD -spina bifida, anencephaly, hydrocephalus
		- Caudal Dysplasia
	- GUT
		- Ureteric Duplication
		- Cystic Kidney
		- Duplex ureters
	- GIT
		- Anorectal atresia

#### Neonate
- Hypoglycemia 
	- First hours of life due to hyperinsulinemia
- Respiratory Distress Syndrome
	- Hyperinsulinemia, blocks cortisol which stimulates type 2 cells in the lungs
- Cardiomyopathy
- Hyperbilirubinemia
- Polycythemia

### Treatment
Multidisciplinary approach
##### Pre-natal
- Screen for complications
	- Retinopathy - eye clinic
	- Nephropathy - RFT
	- Thyroid dysfunction - (type1)
	- Urine culture
	- Ketonemia
- DVT prophylaxis, preeclampsia prevention, 
- Fetal Ultrasound
	- Dating scan
	- Anomaly scan 18-20wks
	- Growth scan monthly 28-36wks
- Diet and exercise
- Medications
	- Metformin
	- Insulin injections
	- Continous insulin infusion
	- Glibenclamide
- Follow up once or biweekly
- Monitor fasting, premeal, bedtime, postmeal
- Target 
	- Fasting 5.3
	- 1 hr postprandial 7.8
	- 2hrs postprandial 6.4
	
##### Antenatal
- Monitor blood glucose hourly motehr and baby
- MOnitor and manage complications in baby

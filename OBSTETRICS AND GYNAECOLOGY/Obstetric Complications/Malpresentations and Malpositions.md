**Presentation** is the lowest pole of the fetus that presents to cervix

Types of malpresentations
1. Breech  presentation
2. Face presentation
3. Brow presentation
4. Cord presentation
5. Compound presentation
6. Transverse lie with shoulder/arm presentation

# Breech

Defined as fetal breech or buttocks presenting in the birth canal

#### Incidence at weeks

| Gestation (weeks) | Percentage Breech |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 21 to 24          | 33%               |
| 25 to 28          | 28%               |
| 29 to 32          | 14%               |
| 33 to 36          | 9%                |
| 37 to 40          | 7 %               |


### Predisposing factors
1. Fetal Anomalies
	- Anencephaly, Hydrocephalus (Head)
	- Spina Bifida
	- Chromosomal Anomalies
	- Multiple Anomaly Syndrome
2. Prematurity
3. Uterine Factors
	- Uterine anomalies
	- Uterine Fibroids
	- Low lying placenta
	- Pelvic Tumors
• High parity 
• Polyhydramnios
•Oligohydramnios
• Multiple pregnancy
• Placenta previa
• Hydrocephalus,anencephaly,downs syndrome,macrosomia

### Complications 
- Perinatal Mortality
- Head entrapment
- Trauma
- Nerve Injury
- Cord Prolapse
- Increased CS ,Genital tract injuries
### Diagnosis
•Abdominal palpation and vaginal exam — leopolds maneuvers the firm
ballotable ,rounded head is felt at fundus
•Vaginal exam — the anus and ischial tuberosities form a straight line
• Ultrasound

## Treating Breech
### External Cephalic Version
- Turning breech to vertex by manipulating mothers abdomen (58% success)
Factors favoring **success**-:
- frank breech
- normal or increased amniotic fluid
- relaxed uterus
Factors favoring **failure**-:
- nulliparity
- obesity
- oligohydramnios
- low breech
- anterior placenta
#### Risks of ECV
- fetal bradycardia
- Abruption
- Fetal & Maternal hemorrhage
- Knotted cord
- Mortality
#### Contraindications
- Contraindications to vaginal delivery
- Non reassuring fetal heart rate tracing
- Multiple gestations with breech
#### Procedure

Preparations
- Confirm breech
- NPO, empty bladder
- NST, CTG, BPP
- Tocolytics - minimize contraction


1. Elevate breech from pelvis using hand suprapubically
2. Push breech into iliac fossa
3. **Flex head and rotate fetus**
4. Avoid excess force ,use massaging motion
5. Allow mother and fetus rest periods when resistance is felt
6. Monitor using ultrasound every 30 sec during rest periods
7. Guide vertex into pelvic brim
8. After ECV monitor for 20 to 30 min
9. In Rh negative patients administer anti D
10. Discontinue If no success in 20 minutes , patient feels sharp pain ,bradycardia

Maneuvers are performed sequentially or as clinically indicated during the different phases of vaginal breech birth — from delivery of legs, shoulders, arms, to the head — to facilitate safe extraction and reduce trauma. They are typically applied after spontaneous delivery advances to critical points, such as after the umbilicus in Pinard or when shoulder or head delivery difficulties arise

|Maneuver|Description & Steps|Purpose/Goal|Important Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Pinard Maneuver**|- Performed after the umbilicus is delivered during breech birth.  <br>- Insert 2 fingers into the popliteal fossa behind the fetal knee.  <br>- Apply pressure to cause spontaneous flexion of the knee, allowing the leg to bend.  <br>- Gently deliver one leg at a time by sweeping the thigh laterally.  <br>- Avoid pulling or traction to prevent injury.|To safely deliver the fetal legs, avoiding traction and injury.|Only performed when the popliteal fossa is visible; done carefully to prevent fetal injury.|
|**Lovset’s Maneuver**|- Holds the fetal pelvis with thumbs on sacrum and fingers around hips.  <br>- Rotate the fetus 90° to bring the anterior shoulder under the symphysis pubis.  <br>- Deliver the anterior arm by sweeping it across the chest.  <br>- Rotate the fetus an additional 180° in the opposite direction.  <br>- Deliver the now anterior arm similarly.|To facilitate delivery of fetal arms and shoulders by rotation and controlled extraction.|Rotation direction depends on fetal position; must be done gently to avoid trauma.|
|**Prague Maneuver**|- Similar to Lovset’s maneuver.  <br>- Involves gradual rotation of the fetal trunk to bring the posterior shoulder anteriorly.  <br>- Helps release the shoulders if dystocia occurs.  <br>- Sometimes used with suprapubic pressure to assist shoulder delivery.|To resolve shoulder dystocia or difficulty delivering the shoulders during breech birth.|Used when arm or shoulder difficulties occur; assists in safe shoulder delivery.|
|**Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit** (MSV)|- Supports the fetal body on one arm (usually forearm).  <br>- Uses two fingers placed on the maxilla to maintain or induce head flexion.  <br>- Gentle downward traction applied to aid head delivery.  <br>- An assistant often applies suprapubic pressure to facilitate flexion and descent.  <br>- Mother’s pushing efforts are encouraged.  <br>- Avoid excessive force to prevent injury.|To safely deliver the fetal head after the body during breech delivery, ensuring flexion to ease passage.|Critical to keep the fetal head flexed to avoid neck injury; assistant pressure aids safe descent.|
|**Burn’s Marshall Maneuver**|- A technique used to flex and guide the after-coming head under the pubic symphysis.  <br>- Gentle manipulation to ensure the head’s optimal position and flexion.  <br>- Helps with delivery of the after-coming head without excessive traction.  <br>- Often used if head is stuck after body and legs delivered.|To deliver the after-coming head safely by flexing and guiding head through the birth canal.|Avoids excessive traction that can cause fetal injury; generally gentle and controlled movement.|
# Face presentation
Occurs where there is complete extension of head so occiput is in contact with the back
### Causes include:
- Multiparity with pendulous abdomen
- Contracted pelvis
- Anencephaly
- Congenital goitre
- Twist of cord several times around the neck
- Increased tone of extensor muscles of the neck

# Cord Presentation And Cord Prolapse
- Loop of cord below the presenting part
- In prolapse membranes have ruptured and cord prolapsed in vagina
25-50% perinatal mortality from asphyxia
Especially when presenting part does not fit well in
lower uterine segment
1. Fetal causes;
	Malpresentations eg footling breech, tranverse lie
	Prematurity
	Anencephaly
	Multiple pregnancy
	Polyhydramnios
2. Maternal;
	Contracted pelvis
	Pelvic tumors
	Placenta previa
	Sudden rupture of membranes

#### Diagnosis
By Vaginal Examination
If prolapsed -
- Is it pulsating?
- Auscultate fetal heart sounds
- Fetal Heart tone and tracings

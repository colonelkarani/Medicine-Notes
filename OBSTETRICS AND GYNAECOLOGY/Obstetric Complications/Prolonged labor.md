Labor lasting for more than 24hrs

Stages of Labor are:
1. 1st stage
2. 2nd stage
3. 3rd stage
4. 4th stage

[[Stages of labor]]

#### Causes of prolonged labour
Causes: 3 Ps
3Ps-passage,passenger,power
1. **Passage**:
	- abnormal pelvis(cephalopelvic disproportion), 
	- contracted pelvis,
	- pelvic tumor
	- fibroids
2. **Passenger**:
	- large,
	- malposition(baby should be facing backwards),
	- malpresentation,
	- fetal abnormalities
3. **Power**:
	- Inadequate contractions,
	- Uncordinated
4. **Psyche** Stress of the mother

Management prolonged labour
•  Assess to find the cause
• Manage accordingly e.g

- Inadequate contractions-->augument(oxytocin,artificial rupture),
- Cephalopelvic disproportion **CPD**-ceaserean
section,malpresentation e.g transverse lie-CS,
- Malposition eg occipito posterior position-
vaginal rotation or cs
- Prolonged 2nd stage assisted vaginal delivery if
no contraindications/augument/cs


### Complications of prolonged labour
#### Maternal:
- maternal distress,
- operative delivery,
- Postpartum haemorrhage,
- sepsis,
- obstetric fistula,
- secondary infertility
#### Fetal complications
-  birth asyphyxia,
-  birth trauma,
-  still birth,
-  neonatal death,
-  neonatal sepsis,
-  cerebral palsy
-  mental subnormality

### Obstructed labour
Definition-failure of labour to progress(cervical dilatation and descent) despite adequate contractions


#### Causes of obstructed labour
##### Maternal:
- Contracted pelvis:
- Abnormal pelvis:android,anthropoid:
- Pelvic tumors e.g fibroids,
- Cervical stenosis,vaginal septum
##### Fetal
- macrosomia > 4kg,
- Abnormal presentation e.g brow,shoulder,face with chin posterior,trasverse lie,
- Malposition e.g persistent occipital posteriorPosition(POPP)
- Fetal abnormalities-hydrocephalus,locked twins,abdominal masses,ascites,hydrops

| **Distended bladder**                                                             | Can cause a prominent lower abdominal ridge or swelling similar to the raised Bandl’s ring; bladder distension is common in prolonged labor due to urinary retention[](https://www.open.edu/openlearncreate/mod/oucontent/view.php?id=277&section=1.5.2)[](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/3-3-uterine-rupture-51416296.html). |
| **Uterine rupture or impending rupture**                                          | Presents with abnormal abdominal contour, pain, and possibly a palpable defect; can be confused with or coexist with Bandl’s ring but rupture involves tearing of the uterine wall[](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/bandl-ring)[](https://medicalguidelines.msf.org/en/viewport/ONC/english/3-3-uterine-rupture-51416296.html).                        |

| **Contraction (pathological) ring dystocia**                                      | Localized uterine muscle tetany causing a constriction ring not at the segment junction but over the fetal body; differs from Bandl’s ring which is at upper-lower segment junction[](https://jcgo.org/index.php/jcgo/article/download/381/222).                                                                                                         |
| **Abdominal wall contour changes due to fetal position or prominent fetal parts** | May simulate a raised ridge on abdominal exam in certain fetal malpositions[](https://www.ijrcog.org/index.php/ijrcog/article/download/1331/1219).                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### Management of obstructed labour
 - IV fluids to correct dehydration
- Give broad spectrum antibiotics
- Supportive care-birth companion
- Sodium bicarbonate to correct acidosis
- Delivery-emergency cs-live fetus,high head,cervix
not fully dilated.
- Fetus is dead- destructive vaginal delivery e.g craniotomy or cs if no skills for destructive delivery or not culturally acceptable
- Continue broad spectrum iv antibiotics and fluids afterdelivery
-  Prevent PPH-
	- syntocinon 20-40 IU in 500mIs
	- normal saline at 20 drops/min(4-6hrs),
	- misoprostoI 800mcq PR/orally
- Thromboprophylaxis for atleast 5 days,earlyambulation,stockings
- Rest bladder with indwelling foleys catheter for lO- 14 days to prevent vvf
- Neonate-antibiotics,close observation in neonatal unit
- Psychosocial support in unfavourable outcomes




#### Complications of obstructed labour
##### Maternal
- uterine rupture,
- postpartum haemorhage,
- Chorioamnitis/pueperial sepsis,
- obstetric fistula,
- osteitis,
- obstetric neuropraxia e.g foot drop,
- Deep Venous Thrombosis,
- ashermans syndrome,
- psychological trauma

##### Fetal complications
- fetal distress,
- fetal death,
- neonatal sepsis,
- Birth trauma,
- intracerebral hemorrhage,
- cerebral palsy,
- mental retardation



#### Prevention of obstructed labour
• Skilled birth attendance
• Partograph
• Birth preparedness and complication
readiness
• Childhood nutrition
• Stop early marriages


RUPTURE OF THE UTERUS
• Disruption of the muscular wall of the
pregnant uterus with or without extrussion of
its contents.
• Obstetric catastrophe-major cause of
maternal deaths & perinatal loss>50%
• Usually occurs in labour. May also occur
during pregnancy or delivery
• Common in multigravida

INCIDENCE
• 0.05% of all pregnancies
• 0.8% after lower segment ceserean
section(LSCS)
• >5%-classical ceserean section
• Scar dehisence-O.6%-good outcomes


#### Rupture of the uterus:classification
• May be complete or incomplete
• Complete-uterus directly communicates with
peritoneal cavity.(full thickness).usually
contents escape to peritoneal cavity
• Incomplete uterine rupture(occult)-the
rupture does not reach the visceral
peritoneum

Uterine rupture-causes
• Obstructed labour,
• Injudiciuos use of uterotonics e.g overdose**one of the dangerous is misoprostol(*common is 25mg not 200mg*/)**
**another dangerous is oxytocin(**lower doses like 5 or 2.5**)**
• Previous uterine
surgery:cs,myomectomy,previous repaired
uterine rupture,metroplasty,D&C,


Causes of uterine rupture before
labour
-  placenta percreta,
invasive mole,choriocarcinoma,
cornual pregnancy,
abdominal trauma(accident,knive,bullet),
- congenital abnormalities e.g pregnancy in
undeveloped uterine horn,
overdistension(multiple pregnancy,hydramnios)
• NB:most cases are due to previous cs


RUPTURE OF A PREVIOUS CS SCAR
• Risk of rupture in 1 previous scar:O.2-1.5%
.Risk of rupture in classical scar:4-9%
Low vertical : 1-7%

Criteria for VBAC
only one previous cesarean section;
low transverse uterine incision;
> original indication for cesarean not
necessarily recurring in subsequent
pregnancies;
benign postoperative course;
non-complicated current pregnancy
(macrosomia, malposition, multiple
gestation).

Clinical features
• Warning signs-bandls ring,tenderness on
lower segment,fetal distress
• Maternal signs:shock,abnormal abdominal
distension,tender abdomen,shoulder
pain,contractions cease,haematuria,vaginal
bleeding,recession of presenting part
• Foetal-easily palpable fetal parts,absent fetal
heart/fetal distress, presenting part receding

#### management
- seek assistance
- Resuscitation-IV fluids,iv antibiotics,blood
grouping  & crossmatch
- Emergency laparotomy
-  Repair if rupture is clean,linear(or no skills for
hysterectomy)
- Ocult cases-freshen wound edges and repair
-  Repair and tubal ligation-extensive damage
&carrying another pregn is risky
-  Hysterectomy-subtotal/total if extensive damage
is present
• Risk management-clinical audits
• Postnatal counseling-treatment offered,
future pregnancy
• Risk of rupture in subsequent pregnancy is
high hence elective cs recommended

complications
. Death
• Haemorhage
. Shock
. Sepsis
• Ureteral damage
• Thrombophlebitis
• Asherman syndrome
• infertility


prevention
Avoid obstructed labour
Proper estimation of fetal weight to avoid traumatic delivery
Proper use of oxytocics
Proper closure of cs incision
Proper selection of patients for vaginal birth after cesarian sectionVBAC

Subsequent ANC
Risk of rupture high
Regular ANC visits
Admit at age of viability(28-32 wks) so that
incase of silent rupture baby and mother can
be saved.
Deliver at 37-38 weeks

Short answer question
A primigravida was admitted in spontaneous labour at 40 weeks
gestation 14 hrs ago.Fetal membranes had ruptured
spontaneously 12 hours ago before admission.Her cervix was 3
cm on admission.The cervix has remained at 8cm for the last 4 hrs
and in addition she now has pyrexia of 37.8 degrees celsius.The
fetal heart is normal.
A) under what conditions will you do a cesearean section on this
patient?
She is eventually delivered by cesarean section because of
obstructed labour.
B) what signs may be present in obstructed labour
C) what complications may affect this mother& fetus
D) how will you minimize any maternal complications

CASE STUDY:J.N
• J N was years old primigravida.She went into Labour
at home and traditional birth attendant was called to
deliver her.She had not delivered in 2 days and mother
decided to take her to a health centre.
• In the health centre she was assessed and referred to
the District hospital..At the District Hospital she was
reviewed and found her to have obstructed
labour.Ceserean delivery was advised. Unfortunately
the hospital did not have an operating theatre hence
referred to the regional hospital(level 5) which was 50
km away.

- It is uterine bleeding after 28 weeks before delivery of fetus that is unrelated to labor and delivery
### Causes of APH
• Placenta previa (20 percent)
• Abruptio placenta (30 percent)
• Uterine rupture (rare)
• Vasa previa (rare)
• Cervical Lesions
• Vaginal lesions
• Unidentified causes

### Epidemiology
A leading cause of maternal mortality

**Digital Vaginal Examination should be avoided until placenta previa is excluded**
**Speculum Exam is used**

# 1. Placenta previa
When the placenta is completely or partially covers the lower uterine segment
![types-of-placenta-previa.png (2400×1020)](https://www.invitra.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/types-of-placenta-previa.png)

1. Type 1 (Low Lying)
	- Placenta encroaches lower segment but doesnt  reach internal os
2. Type 2 (Marginal)
	- Reaches margin of internal os but does not cover it
3. Type 3 (Partial Previa)
	- Partially covers the internal os
4. Type 4 (Complete Previa)
	- Completely covers the internal os cervix cannot dilate

## Clinical Presentation
**Often begins with painless bleeding**
70 -80% women with low lying placenta bleed
• Can start as spotting in 1st trimester.
• 1/3 initial bleeding in < 30 weeks associated
with transfusion , pre--term delivery and
high perinatal mortality
• 1/3 bleed between 30--36 weeks
• 1/3 bleed after 36 weeks
• 10% reach term without bleeding
• Bleeding more in third trimester

### Risk Factors
- Endometrial Scarring 
	- Increased CS occurences
	- Increased Parity
	- Increased Maternal Age
	- Increased Curettage
- Increased placental surface(to increase fetal oxygenation) due to
	- Maternal Smoking
	- Residence at high altitude
	- Multiple Gestation
#### Co-ocurring conditions
1. Placenta Accreta
2. Fetal Malpresentation
3. Premature Rupture of Membranes
4. Intra Uterine Growth Restriction
5. Premature Labor And Delivery

## Clinical Evaluation
- Sterile speculum examination followed by a diagnostic ultrasound **(safest)**
-  Check hemodynamic Status
## Management
Priority to **ABCs / Hemodynamic stabilization**
Depends on 
1. Asymptomatic mothers (routine scan) **>20 weeks**
	- Give steroids to mature lungs if **28-34 weeks**
	- sonographic follow-up **4 weeks interval after 28 weeks**
	- Avoid coitus or vaginal exam
	- Exercise restriction
	- Counselling 
	- Case base analysis
		- return to hospital quickly
		- Adult companion 24hrs
		- Understands the risk
2. Actively Bleeding Mothers 
	- Requires admission till it stops
	- IV line/Crystalloids
	- Maintain hemodynamic stability
	- Group and crossmatch
	- Monitor rate of bleeding and hemodynamic parameters
	- Coagulation Screening
	- Emergency delivery if it continues to bleed
3. Stable after episodes of active bleeding

### Indications for delivery
Non reassuring fetal status
Life threatening refractory maternal hemorrage
Elective at 37 weeks

### Delivery
type 1 ,2(anterior) --> vaginal
type 2(posterior), 3, 4 --> CS
**Always have blood ready**

# 2. Abruptio Placenta

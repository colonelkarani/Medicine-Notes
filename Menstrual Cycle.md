Normal menstrual cycle takes  about 28 days

There are 4 hormones which are involved:
1. Follicular Stimulating Hormone
2. Leutenizing Hormone
3. Oestrogen
4. Progesterone

There are 2 phases:
1. Follicular phase - Ovum in follicle
2. Luteal phase **always 14 days** - Corpus luteum in follicle

Follicular phase
 - Day 1 hypothalamus release gonadotropin releasing hormone GRH
 - stimulate anterior pituitary to release FSH (development of follicles) , LH (ovulation)
 - fsh stimulate follicles so that cells surrounding granulosa increase oestrogen
 - oestrogen
	 - negative feedback
	 - stimulate development of 
		 - breast 
		 - vulva
	 - thin the mucus
- Ovulation happens at day 14

Luteal phase
- Follicle that releases ovary becomes corpus luteum
- Releases progesterone
- Opposes action of estrogen
- If fertilised it releeases HCg and maintains corpus luteum
- Endometrium to break down and menstruation to occur

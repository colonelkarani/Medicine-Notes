### Recap on normal menstrual cycle
[[Menstrual Cycle]]

### Figo systems for symptoms of bleeding *system 1*

FIGO systems are **only used in non-gestational AUB**

**Chronic AUB** - bleeding abnormal in duration, volume frequency, regularity in majority of *6 months*

**Acute AUB**  - episode of heavy bleeding that requires intervention to minimize further blood loss 

FIGO system 1 entails
1. Frequency
2. Duration
3. Regularity
4. Flow Volume
5. Intermenstrual Bleeding
6. Bleeding on progestin + estrogen  eg birth control pills

### Figo systems for causes of bleeding *system 2*

the mnemonic is PALM COIEN

##### Stuctural causes include:
P- **POLYPS**
- Cervical canal , endometrial cavity
- Dx by contrast 
	- sonography, 
	- histopathology, 
	- TVS,
	- Saline Infusion Sonohysterography
A- **ADENOMYOSIS**

L- leiomyoma
M- malignancy and hyperplasis

##### Non structural causes include
C-coagulopathy
O- ovulatory disorders
I- iatrogenic
E - endometrial disorders
N - not otherwise classified

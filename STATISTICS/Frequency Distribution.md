To prepare a **frequency distribution** for the heights of 20 people, you can follow these clear steps:

## Step 1: Collect the Data

Gather the height measurements of the 20 individuals.

## Step 2: Determine the Range

Calculate the range by subtracting the smallest height from the largest height.

Range=Maximum height−Minimum heightRange=Maximum height−Minimum height

## Step 3: Decide the Number of Classes (Intervals)

Choose how many class intervals to divide the data into. A common rule is between 5 and 10 classes for 20 data points. You can also use Sturges’ formula:

K=1+3.3log⁡10(N)K=1+3.3log10(N)

where N=20N=20.

## Step 4: Calculate Class Width

Divide the range by the number of classes and round up to a convenient number:

Class Width=RangeNumber of ClassesClass Width=Number of ClassesRange

## Step 5: Create Class Intervals

Start with the minimum height as the lower limit of the first class. Add the class width to get the upper limit of the first class and the lower limit of the next class. Continue until all data values are covered.

## Step 6: Tally Frequencies

Go through the dataset and count how many heights fall into each class interval. Record these counts as frequencies.

## Step 7: Construct the Frequency Distribution Table

Make a table with two columns:

|Height Interval (cm)|Frequency|
|---|---|
|e.g., 150 – 159|3|
|160 – 169|7|
|...|...|

## Example Summary:

Suppose the heights range from 150 cm to 190 cm, and you decide on 4 classes:

- Range = 190 – 150 = 40 cm
    
- Class width = 40 / 4 = 10 cm
    

Classes:

- 150–159 cm
    
- 160–169 cm
    
- 170–179 cm
    
- 180–189 cm
    

Then tally how many heights fall into each interval.

This method organizes your data into meaningful groups, making it easier to visualize and analyze the distribution of heights among the 20 people.

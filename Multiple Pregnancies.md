Zygosity - if they are genetically identical

### Epidemiology
Twins 1:89
Triplets 1:89^2

### Etiology / Risk factors
- Advanced maternal age
- Assisted methods of contraception
- Family History
- Previous gestation

### Classifications
1. Monozygotic vs Dizygotic
	- Monozygotic are genetically identical and dizygotic are always dichorionic diamniotic
2. Chorionicity
	1. Day 1 - 3
		- Dichorionic Diamniotic
	2. Day 4-7
		- Monochorionic diamniotic
	3. Day 8 -12
		- Monochorionic monoamniotic
	4. >Day 12 
		- Conjoined

### Clinical Features

	- 2 fetal heart rates

### Labs

	- HCG
	- HPL
	- AFP
- Ultrasound to confirm diagnosis
	- Dichorionic diamniotic
		- Lambda sign
	- Monochorionic Diamniotic
		- T sign
	- Multiple gestation sacs

25 Monozygotic twins:
a) F
b) T
c) F
d) T
e) F
Always have a risk of cord entanglement. 
Each twin has a risk of structural abnormality four times higher than a single fetus.
If diamniotic, they are separated by a membrane carrying the lambda sign.
If monochorionic, twins have a 15 per cent chance of developing twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).
Cannot be dichorionic diamniotic.


26 Higher-order multiple pregnancies:
a) F
b) T
c) F
d) F
e) T
Replacement of only two embryos in in vitro fertilization (IVF) protocols prevents the risk of triplet pregnancy.
The median gestational age of delivery of triplets is 33/40.
Evidence strongly suggests that triplets should be delivered by elective Caesarean section.
If opting for multi-fetal reduction, this should be carried out as soon after diagnosis as possible.
Multi-fetal reduction increases the chance of pregnancy loss before viability.

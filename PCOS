## Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

### Definition
PCOS is a common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age, characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology.

### Epidemiology
- Affects approximately 5-10% of women of reproductive age globally.
- It is a leading cause of infertility due to anovulation.
- Strongly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome.

### Etiology and Pathophysiology
- The exact cause is unknown but multifactorial:
  - Genetic predisposition with family history common.
  - Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia promote ovarian androgen production.
  - Hypothalamic-pituitary axis abnormalities lead to increased LH secretion relative to FSH, stimulating theca cells to produce androgens.
  - Altered steroidogenesis with increased androgen production.
  
- Insulin resistance is central, affecting ovarian function and peripheral metabolism.

### Clinical Features
- Menstrual irregularities: oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea due to chronic anovulation.
- Hyperandrogenism: hirsutism (excess facial/body hair), acne, androgenic alopecia.
- Obesity (especially central obesity) in many but not all patients.
- Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound: multiple small follicles peripherally located (“string of pearls”).
- Infertility due to anovulation.
- Skin changes: acanthosis nigricans (especially in insulin resistance).

### Diagnostic Criteria
The Rotterdam criteria (2003) require two of the following three for diagnosis:
1. Oligo- or anovulation.
2. Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism.
3. Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (≥12 follicles measuring 2-9 mm or increased ovarian volume).

Other causes of hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction must be excluded (e.g., thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, Cushing’s syndrome, androgen-secreting tumors).

### Investigations
- Serum total and free testosterone (for hyperandrogenism).
- LH/FSH ratio (commonly elevated LH:FSH > 2).
- Fasting glucose and insulin levels, oral glucose tolerance test (to assess insulin resistance).
- Lipid profile.
- Pelvic ultrasound.
- Exclude other disorders: TSH, prolactin, 17-hydroxyprogesterone.

### Complications
- Infertility.
- Metabolic syndrome: insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes.
- Cardiovascular disease risk.
- Endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma (due to unopposed estrogen effect from anovulatory cycles).
- Psychological effects: depression, anxiety, poor self-esteem.

### Management
Management is multidisciplinary and depends on the patient’s symptoms and reproductive desires:

#### Lifestyle Modification
- Weight loss (5-10%) improves ovulatory function and insulin sensitivity.
- Diet (low glycemic index), regular exercise.

#### Pharmacologic Treatment
- **Menstrual irregularities & endometrial protection:**
  - Combined oral contraceptives (regulate menses, reduce androgens).
  - Progestins for endometrial protection if not on OCPs.

- **Hyperandrogenism:**
  - Anti-androgens (spironolactone, cyproterone acetate) often combined with OCPs.
  - Eflornithine cream for facial hair.

- **Infertility:**
  - Clomiphene citrate (first-line ovulation induction).
  - Letrozole (aromatase inhibitor) has shown better ovulation rates.
  - Metformin improves insulin sensitivity and may help ovulation.
  - Gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian drilling in resistant cases.

- **Metabolic abnormalities:**
  - Metformin for insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.
  - Lipid-lowering agents if dyslipidemia present.

### Follow-up & Counseling
- Regular monitoring for metabolic complications.
- Counseling about risks of endometrial hyperplasia and need for surveillance.
- Psychological support as needed.
